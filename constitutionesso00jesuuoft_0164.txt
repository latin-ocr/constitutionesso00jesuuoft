in number; so ought those to be dismissed who are not so;
and of whom it may appear, in the course of time, either that
that this is not their calling, or that it is not to the common
interest of the Society that they continue in it. But as we
ought not to be too easy in granting admission; so, still less
should we be too free in dismissing3 but proceed with all con-
sideration and circumspectiori in the Lord. And although it is
proper that the causes deserving dismissa] be the more weighty‚
in proportion to the closeness of the individual’s connexion with
the body of the Society3 still, however intimately he may be
united, in certain cases he may and ought to be removed3 as
will appear in the following chapter.

The power of dismissa] belongs, in the first place, to the Society
at large, when it may assemble in general Congregation. It is
vested also in the Genera] in all cases excepting those con-
cerning his own person. So much of this power may be con-
ferred upon other members of this Society as the Genera] shall
determine. On Provincials it is expedient that very ample
power be conferred; and in due proportion, also, upon local
Superiors and Rectors of colleges, in cases where it shall seem
fit3 that thus, throughout the body of the Society, the sub-
ordination qf lcoly Obeclience be better maintained; whereby
inferiors may more distinctly understand that they depend upon
their immediate superiors, and that it is highly expedient, and

even necessary, to obey them in all things, for the sake of
Christ our Lord.

 

OF THE CAUSES FOR WHICH ῙΤ Is EXPEDIENT THAT
ANY ONE BE DISMISSED.

CHAP. ΙΙ.

THE prudent charity of the Superior who has this power should
weigh before the Lord the causes which may justify the dis-
missal of any one; but generally speaking, there seem to be
four kinds of them.

First; if it should appear in the Lord to be contrary to His
honour and glory, that an individua] should continue in this
Society, who seems to be incorrigible in any depraved affections
or vices offensive to the divine Majesty3 which should be the
less tolerated, the more serious and culpable they are : and that
