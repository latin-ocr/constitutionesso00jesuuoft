him who strips himself of his possessions follow Christ’s com-
mands: he may, however, in his devotion bestow his property,
or a portion of it, upon one object rather than another, as he
shall perceive it most agreeable to the divine pleasure, as is
set forth in the Examen.

Let them learn, also, that they may by no means borrow, or
lend, or give away anything that is in the House, except with
the knowledge and consent of the Superior.

Whoever at his entrance, or after his entrance, impelled by his
own feelings of devotion to Obedience, may desire to dispense
his property, or a part of it, to the benefit qf the Society, would
doubtless accomplish a work of greater perfection, alienation,
and denial of all sels-love, by not descending through any weak

Let them be taught how to detect the illusions of the devil in
their spiritual exercises, and how to defend themselves against
all temptations; at the same time let them learn the means,
sought out with all possible diligence, to be resorted to in

overcoming temptations, and employed in acquiring real and
solid virtues3 whether their spiritual visitations be more or less
frequent, let them always make advancement in the way of God's
service.

Let them daily resort to an habitual examination of their con-
science, and at least once a week go to the sacraments of Con-
fession and the Communi0n; eoecept for some reason the Superior
determine otherwise3 and let there be appointed one Confessor
for all by the Superior: and if this is not practicable‚ let each
have his own regular Confessor, to whom he may unreservedly
