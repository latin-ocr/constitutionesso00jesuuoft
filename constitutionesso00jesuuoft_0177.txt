THE soemTY or ansus. :25

suffer detriment; so any bodily exercise, which aids either, is
generally necessary for all, those not exceptcd who ought to be
occupied in mental pursuits, which should be interrupted by
external employments, and not continued nor taken up without
some measure of discretion.

’·” The castigation of the body should neither be immoderate nor
indiscreet in vigils, fastingS, and other externa] penances and
labours‚ which usually do harm, and hindei· better things. It is
expedient therefore that whatever is done in this way be disclosed
by each one to his Confessor, who should refer it to the Superior
if he thinks that moderatiori is exceeded, or even doubts of
the excess. Au these things, however, are done, that we may
proceed more clearly, and that greater glory be given to God
our Lord, both in our souls and bodies.

Let there be some one in every House to preside over everything
that relates to the good health of the body, and as well for
maintaining it in the healthy as in those more especially who from
age and other causes are more weakly, as in restoring it to the
sick, to which person all ought immediately to refer, if they
feel themselves unwell; that the convenient remedy be provided,
as charity requires.

⁴ In whatever relates to the protection of tempora] property,
beyond that duty which reason and charity impose upon au, it
will be proper that some one be delegated to the office, to watch
over it, as though it belonged to our Lord J esus Christ.

For all other duties, and those especially which are performed
more decently at home than abroad, care must be taken that an
adequate number of officials be appointed; rand let the Coad-
jutors in externa] things learn these duties if they are not al-
ready acquainted with them, always directing everything to the
greater glory of God our Creator and Lord.
