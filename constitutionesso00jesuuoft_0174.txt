also of communicating‚ of hearing the mass, and ministering in
it; of pmying, meditating and reading according to each man’s
taient ; and let it bc seen to that they not only learn what they
ought, but that they remember, and practise what they learn:
let all employ their time in spiritual concerns, and persist in
acquiring habits of devotion according to the measure of the
grace of God communicated to them3 to which it will greatly
contribute to assign certain or even all the spiritual exercises to
such as have not hitherto employed themselves in them3 as shall
be judged most expedient for each in the Lord.

It is fit that all be practised in preaching at home (except the
Superior exempt any one) so that beyond the useful employment
of an hour after dinner, they may be encouraged and habituated
in some degree (as to voice, and manner, and other particulars)
to discharge that duty; and to give some evidence of the talent
which the Lord communicates to them in this department;

their neighbours' edification, frequently treating of those subjects
which relate to self-denial, advancement in virtue, and perfectioris
of all sorts3 mutually exhorting one another to these things,
and above all to union and brotherly love.

devotion, in which humility and charity are more especially
necessary. And generally speaking, the more closely each one

supreme Majesty ; so much the more bountiful he wil] find God
towards him ; and he will daily become more qualified to receive
grace and ampler spiritual gifts.
