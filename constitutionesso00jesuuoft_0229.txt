shall set forth to the appointed place, leaving deputies in their

to the general Congregation most devoutly to God in their
prayers and the sacrifice of the 1nass; and implore that what-
ever is transacted therein may turn out to the greater service

OF THE MANNER OF DELIBERATION, WHEN A GENERAL IS
TO BE ELECTED.

CHAP. VI.

11³· the meeting is appointed for the election of a new General
to take the place of one deceased ; as soon as all are assembled‚
the Vicar Genera] shall address them on the subject, four
days before the election of the future General, and exhort them
to conduct it as becomes the greater service of God, and the
good government of the Society: and besides this day, they
shall have the three following, to commend themselves to God,
and more maturely to consider, who of all the Society is best
qualified for this trust3 and they shall take care to be informed
in this period of everything relating to the business, by those
who can properly instruct thern: but they shall not until they
enter the place of election‚ and are confined within it, determine
111 their own minds, whom they will elect.

Throughout this intervening time every one shall be bound on
pain of the sentence of excommunication being passed upon
111111, to communicate to the V icar General, or to some one of
the elders among the Professed, who shall communicate with
the Vicar General, if he knows that any member has aspired to
this office, or is even then aspiring‚ procuring it directly or
indirectly, or manifesting it by any sign. And he who shall be
convicted of such ambition, shall be deprived of his suffrage,
active and passive, as one not competent to elect another, nor to
be himself elected; for which reason he shall not be admitted
to that' nor any future meeting.
