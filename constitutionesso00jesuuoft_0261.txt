established. He determined, also, that whoever was disposed to
found any new religious house, should submit it to some of the
rules or institutions already approved. From hence it results that
no one has a right to found any new order, without the special
permission of the Roman pontiff, and that with very good reason ;
the rather, as the end of the new institutions being the attainment
of a greater degree of perfection, it is proper that the Apostolic
See should previously and carefully examine the rules of conduct
proposed to be laid down, lest great inconveniencies, and even
scandals, should be introduced into the church of God, under the
specious appearance of a greater good.

Notwithstanding the wisdom of these dispositions of Innocent
III. in after times eoecess qf importunity wruny from tlte Holy
See the approbation of divers regular orders; nay, such was the
arroyant temerity of many individuals, that an infinite number of
orders, especially mendicants, started up without any permission at
all. To remedy this abuse, Gregory X. likewise our predecessor,
renewed the constitution of Innocent III. in the Genera] Council at
Lyons, and forbad every one, under the most severe penalties, to
invent thereafter any new orders, or to wear the habit of them.
And as to the new institutions and mendicant orders, established
after the Council of Lateran, and not then approved by the Holy
See, he abolished them all; and with regard to those which had
then been confirmed by the Apostolic See, he ordained, that those
who had already taken the vows might, if they saw good, remain
in them, on condition that they received no new members, that
they acquired no new houses, lands, or possessions whatever, and
that they did not alienate the possessions they then had, without
the express permission of the Apostolic See. And further, he
reserved Ι10 1118 53111 See the disposition of all the goods and pos-
sessions, to be carried to the subsidies destined for the Holy Land,
or for the poor, or for other pious uses, and that through the channe]
of the Ordinary of the place, or of such other person 35 1118 Holy
See should appoint. He prohibited likewise the members of the said
orders to preach, confess, 'or even inter any other dead except those
of their own order. He declared, however, that the orders and
preachers called “Fratres Minores,¹' should be exempted from this
constitution, inasmuch as the evident advantage the Catholic church
reaped from them, entitled them to an entire approbation. He
ordained, likewise‚ that the order of the Hermits of St. Augustine.
