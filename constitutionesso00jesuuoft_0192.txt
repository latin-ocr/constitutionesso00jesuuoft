according both to the general interest and also that of the

Lord, keeping them in their places, or removing them: and
generally speaking, he shall sce that that which has been set
forth in the previous ehapters relating to the Colleges, be
observed. Let him be mindful also of the subordination to be
entirely maintained in Obedience, not only to the General, but
to the Provincial also, informing him of all things needful to be
communicated, and referring to him everything of moment;
obeying all his injunctions (seeing he 3150 1135 a Superior) ; as it

by those who live in the College ; who should greatly revere and
venerate their Rector, as one who holds the place of Christ our
Lord, leavinq to him the free disposition of themselves and their
coneerns with unfeiqned obedience; keepinq nothinq concealed from
