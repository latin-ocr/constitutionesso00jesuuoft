labour to the utmost of our power to satisfy and to fulfil them.
To this effect wc implore without ceasing the protection and the aid
of God, that he would inspire us and all his flock with counsels of
peace, and open to us the road which leads to it. We know,
besides, that we are established by the Divino Providence over kinq-
(loms (end nations, in order to pluclc up, clestroy, disperse, dissipate,
plant or nourish, as may best conduce to the right cultivation of
the vineyard of Sabbaoth, and to the preservation of the edifice of
the Christian religion, of which Christ is the chief corner-stone.
In consequence hereos we have ever thought and been constantly
of opinion, that as it is our duty carefully to plant and noui-ish
whatever may conduce in any manner to the repose and tranquillity
of the Christian republic, so the bond of mutual charity requires
that we be equally ready and disposed to pluck up and destroy even

It is beyond a doubt, that amonq the thinqs which contribute to

people, did not produce those advantages which were hoped for at
their instituti0n; if at any time they seemed disposed rather to
trouble than maintain the public tranquillity; the same Apostolic
See, which had availcd itself of its own authority to establish these
orders, did not hesitate to reform them by new laws, to recall them
to their primitive institution, or even totally to abolish them where
it has seemed necessary. Upon motives like these, Innocent III.
our predecessor, having considered that the too great multiplicity of
regular orders served only to bring confusion into the church of
God, did, in the fourth Council of Late-ran, forbid all persons to
invent any new rcligious institution, and counsel all those who were
called to the monastic life, to embrace one of the orders already
