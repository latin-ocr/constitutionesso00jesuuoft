of the Lord: that is, whether the Holy Spirit Who guides them,
promises to them so much grace, that they may hope with His
assistance to sustain the burden of this vocation : and when, by the
inspiration of God, they have enrolled their name in this warfare of
J ESUS Christ, their loins should be girded night and day, and they
should be ready for the discharge of so great a debt. And that
there may be no secking or refusing among ourselves of missions
or provinces of any kind, let each profess that he will never directly
or indirectly solieit any thing of the Roman Pontiff touching such
missions: but refer all this care to God, and the Pontiff as his
Vicar, and to the General of the Society. The General also shall
profess, like the rest, that he will not solicit of the said Pontiff

shall be more learned he may endeavour to evade-this duty, as at
first sight perhaps less engaging: whilst in fact none is more
productim, either of edification to our neighbour‚ or of the prac-
tice of the dutics of charity and humility to ourselves. Inferiors
moreover shall be always bound to obey the Genera] in all things
pertaining to the Institute of the Society, as well for the great
advantages of order, as for the never-to-be-sufficiently lauded
diligent exorciso of humility3 and shall recognize Christ, as thouyh
present in stim, and as far as is bccmning, worship him. And since
we have experienccd that a life most remote from every contagioni
