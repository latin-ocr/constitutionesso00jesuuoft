THE socmrr OF snsus. 35

As the over earnestness of some in their studies ought to be
repressed‚ so others who require it ought to be stimulated,
incited, and animated to their duties; and that the Rector may
more effectually do this, he should ascertain himself, from
persona] observation and by means of another to whom he shall
have entrusted the office of Syndic or Visitor of Studies, in what
way the Scholars do their duty. And if he shall perceive that
any one during his studies wastes his time, that he is unwilling,
or unable to make progress in literature; it will be proper to
remove him, and put some one in his place, who shall make
more proficiency in the object appointed in the Colleges for
God's service.

Τὴθ study of any faculty being completed, it will be well to go
over it again in private, reading one or more authors than before,
at the Rector's discretion. He may moreover reduce to writing,
if the Rector thinks proper, more briefly, distinctly, and ac-
curately‚ whatever in that same faculty he had previously written
during the course of lectures when he had less skill than now at
the conclusion of the course.

At the appointed times let them prepare themselves for the
public examinations and responses ; and they who after diligent
scrutiny may be found worthy shall be advanced to the usual
degrees. Let them not however assume any particular places,
although such as are generally assigned in the University
wherein they take their degree, that they may avoid every ap-
pearance qf ambition ancl other inordinate passions; but let them
all arrange themselves together without precedence, and incur no
expense unbecoming paupers in these degrees, to which they
should be advanced without detriment to their humility, and
with no other motive than to render themselves more useful to
their neighbours to the glory of God.

Whether it may be better for their own benefit or that of others
for those who have accomplished the course of their studies, to
read privately or publicly, shall be left to the judgment of the
Superior who shall determine whatever he may think most ex-
pedient in the Lord.
