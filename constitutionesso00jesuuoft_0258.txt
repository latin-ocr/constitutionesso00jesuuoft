106 BULL OF PAUL 111.

Now seeing that We find nothing in the premises, which is not
godly or holy; We, (that these same Associates who have most
humbly petitioned Us herein may be so much more earnest in this
their pious intention of living, and the more because they know that
they are cherished by the favour of the Apostolic See, and may per-
ceive that the premises are approved of by Us,) by our Apostolical
authority, according to the tenor of these presents, of our certain
knowledge approve, confirm, and bless, and strengthen with the
protection of perpetual steadfastness all and singular the premisae
as meet for the spiritual advancement of the Associates, and of all
the rest of the Christian flock: and we receive the Associates
under our protection, and that of the holy Apostolic See: con-
ceding to them moreover, that some among them may freely and
lawfully draw up such Constitutions as they shall judge to be
conformable to the object of the Society, and to the glory of Jesus
Christ our Lord, and the advantage of our neighbour. Any other
Apostolical Constitutions and decrees of the general Council, and
of our predecessor, Pope Gregory X. of happy memory, and any
others whatsoever to the contrary, notwithstanding. We will
moreover that in this Society there be admitted to the number of
sixty persons only, desiring to embrace this rule of living, and no
more; and to be incorporated into the Society aforesaid*

Let no man therefore infringe, or with rash audacity contravene
this document of our approbation, confirmation, benediction, cor-
roboration, reception, concession, and pleasure. And if any man
should presume to attempt it, let him know that he will incur the
indignation of Almighty God, and of St. Peter and St. Paul his
Apostles.

Given at Rome, at St. Mark’s, in the year of the
Incarnation of our Lord, 1540. September
27. In the sixth year of our Pon'tifieate.

’ἓ This limitation os the number to sixty was abrogated by the Bull of the
same Pope Paul ΠΙ. bearing date 14 March, 1543.
