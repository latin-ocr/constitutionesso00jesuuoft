iv PREFACE.

Jesuite, arc taken from an edition printed at Rome in 1583. There
is a volume of the CONSTITUTIONES, in small 8v0‚ in the
British Museum, Romae, 1570.

The edition of Prague‚ in 2 vols. fol. 1757, is that which was
produced on the trial of La valette, wherein the CONSTITUTI-
ONES occupies 91 pages : “ and although it is clear to me‚'’ says
Mr. Penrose,* “that numerous additions have incontestably been
made to the original Constitutions, some, perhaps, such as partially
to supersede them, yet no alteration in the letter of the statute kas
taken place: and whatever infidelities may have been committed in
other instances, there is no reason to apprehend that the text of
the CONSTITUTIONES SOCIETATIS JESU, ROMAE, 1570,
has at any time been violated. This also, I believe, was a re-
impression from a preceding edition in 1550.’' (1558.)

It was in 1558, that the volume of CONSTITUTIONES,
translated from the Spanish of Loyola by Father John Polancus,
was originally committed to the press by the College of the Society
in Rome ε a copy of this edition has fallen into the Editor's hands3
it is in small Svo, and so exceedingly rare, that he has no where
seen it mentioned except in the Synopsis of Damianus‚ a work of

almost equal scarcity, and in the foregoing paragraph where it

* 1 have collated several pages, and the most essential passages, of the
edition printed at Rome in 1570, and that of Antwerp in 1702, which have
both of them the sanction of the Society. So far as 1 have compared them,
thoy are preciscly similar. The Chapters and sections are apparently the sanic
in each.
