01³· THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE ADMITTED SCHOLARS.

CHAP. IV.

Lm that suffice, which is set forth in the Third Part, of the
superintendence of temporal and external affairs of the Colleges,
in all that relates to the body. This however must be noted
with peculial· care, that the Scholars study not at seasons un-
favourable to bodily health; that they devote sufficient time to
sleep, and observe moderation in their mental labours. So will
it come to pass that they will be able longer to persevere both
in the acquisition of learning and in employing it to the glory
of God.

In what relates to spirituals; the ordering of those who are
admitted into the Colleges, and of those admitted into the
Houses wil] be the same, so long as they are under Probation.
After Probation‚ when they are at leisure to acquire learning, as
on the one hand care must be taken lest in the eagerness of
study the love of the solid virtues and a religious life grow cold;
so, on the other, too much time must not be given to mortifica-
tions, prayers, and lengthened meditations. Since to labour in
learning which is acquired with the sincere purpose of serving
God, and in a certain sense requires the whole man, will not be
less pleasing to God, and our Lord, but even more so, than to
be occupied in religious exercises during the time of study.
Therefooe, besides the Sacraments of Confession and Com-
munion (in which they must participate once a week) and the
Mass which they must hear daily, let them employ one hour in
reciting the Office of the most blessed Virgin Mary, and in
examining their consciences twice a day, with other prayers
according to their particular devotion to fill up the hour, if not
already occupied. All which they shall do at the appointment
and judgment of their Superiors to whom as in the place of
Christ they owe Obedience.

Others, such as those Coadjutors who have not learned to read.

besides Mass, may spend an hour also in reciting their Rosary,
