SUPPRESSION OF THE so(·1ETY OF JESUS. 117

We have seen, in the grief of our heart, that neither these
remedies, nor an infinity of others, since employed, have produced
their due effect, or silenced the accusations and complaints against

the said society. Our other predecessors, Urban VII. Clement

IX. X. XI. and XII. Alexander VII. and VIII. Innocent X.
XII. and XIII. and Benedict XIV. employed without effect all

their efforts to the same purpose. In vain did they endeavour, by
salutary constitutions, to restore peace to the Church; as well with
respect to secular affairs, with which the company ought not to
have interfered, as with regard to the missions ; which gave rise to
great disputes and oppositions on the part of the company with the
ordinaries, with other religious orders, about the holy places, and
communities of all sorts in Europe, Africa, and America, to the
great loss of souls, and great scandal of the people; as likewise
concerning the meaning and practice of certain idolatrous cerenzone'es
adopted in certain placeS, in contempt of those justly approved by
the Catholic Church ; and further, concerning the use and explica-

lastly, concerning other matters of great importance and prime
necessity towards preserving the integrity and purity of the
doctrines of the gospel, from which maxims have resulted very
great inconveniencies and great detriment, both in our days and in
past ages3 such as the revolts and intestine troubles in some of the
Catholic states, persecutions against the Church in some countries of
Asia and Europe, not to mention the vexation and grating solicitude
which these melancholy affairs brought on our predecessors, princi-
pally upon Innocent XI. of blessed memory, who found himself
reduced to the necessity of forbiddiny tlte company to receive any
more novices ; and afterwards upon Innocent XIII. who was obliged
to threaten the company with the same punishment; and, lastly,
upon Benedict XIV. who took the resolution of ordaining a genera]
visitation of all the houses and colleges of the company in the
kingdom of our dearly beloved son in J esus Christ, the most faithful
King of Portugal.

The late apostolic letter of Clement XIII. of blessed memory‚
our immediate predecessor, by which the institute of the Company
of Jesus was again approved and recommended, was far from
brinyz'ny any comfort to the Holy See, or any advantaye to the
