chase and sale of all tempora] goods whatsoever as well of the
Houses as the Colleges of the Society, and of raising and re-
deeming any revenues on the freeholds of the Colleges for their
use and benefit, on condition that it may be lawful to aequit
himself of the obligation on restoring the money which shall
have been received. But the General shall not alienate nor
altogether dissolve the Colleges or Houses of the Society once
raised, without a general assembly.
Of such things as are left to the Society to dispose of at its
pleasure, whether they be real property, as a house or estate
not specifically applied or annexed to any particular College by

him, whether Professed or not, (whom he may resolve to send)
to any parts of the world, for any period, definite or indefinite,
as he shall determine, to do any action of those which the
Society is wont to exercise for the succour of souls. He may
recall missionaries, and in short, proceed in all thinqs, as he shall
think will be to the greater glory of God.
He shall arrange the duties of Preachers, Lecturers and Con-
