inasmuch as their institution was prior to the Council of Lateran.
And finally, he permitted the individuals of the orders comprised in
the said constitution, full liberty of transporting themselves and
their effects into any other order already approved; provided only
that no whole order or convent should pass with all their effects
into any one other order, without a previous and express permission

The other Roman pontifis, our predecessors, followed the same
steps, as circumstances required. Among others, Clement V. by a
letter sub plumbo, expedited the 3d of May, in the year 1312,
induced thereto by the general discredit into which the order of
Templars was fallen, did entirely suppress and abolish the said
order, though it had been legally approved, and though, on account

The Pope Urban VIII. our predecessor, of blessed memory‚ did

and for ever suppress the congregation of “Fratres Conventuales
rcformati,’' though this order had been approved by Pope Sixtus V.
who had distinguished it by particular benefactions and favours.
Urban VIII. suppressed it, because the church of God did no
