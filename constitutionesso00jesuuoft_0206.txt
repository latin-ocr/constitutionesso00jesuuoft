ΤΗ Ε CONSTth'TloNs OF

Those who, at the conclusion of their first probation and proofs
usual in the biennium, are admitted to be Scholars, in the
presence of certain inmates, though not to any person, shall make
their V ows in this manner.

Almighty, Everlasting God, Ι. N. albeit every way most unwor-
thy in Thy holy sight, yet relying on Thine infinite pity and
compassion, and impelled by the desire of serving Thee, in the
presence of the most holy Virgin Mary, and before all Thine
heavenly host, vow to Thy divine Majesty‚ perpetual Poverty,
Chastity and Obedience in the Society of Jesus, and promise
that I will enter the same Society, to live in it perpetually;
understanclinq all thinys according( to tlte Constitutions ⁰f the
Society. Of Thy boundless goodness and mercy through the
blood of Jesus Christ I humbly pray that Thou wilt deign to
accept this sacrifice in the odour of sweetnesS‚ and, as Thou
hast granted Thine abundant grace to desire and offer, so Thou
wilt enable me to fulffl the same; At Rome, or elsewhere,
in such a place, day, month and year.

Then shall they take, as the others, the most holy body of
Christ, and the rest of the ceremony shall proceed as before.
NVhen any one shall be adopted into the body of the Society in
any degree, he ought not to be anxious to proceed to another ;
but to be perfect in his own, employing himself in the service of
God, and leaving the care of all other things to his Superior,
who doubtless holds tlte place os Christ our Lord.

' Those who live in our Houses after two years should take the

same vows as the Scholars, and bind themselves to Christ our
Lord ; and that, although they be not put to studies, and al-
though it be not thought expedient that they be admitted so
early among the Coadjutors or the Professed. But if any one.
urged by his private feelings of devotion should wish, before this
period of two years to offer himself to God by Vows, he may
use the same form, and delivering to the Superior one copy of
his written Vow, keep another himself, that what he has offered
to God and our Lord may be remembered. And to this end,
and likewise to increase devotion, it will conduce, at certain
stated aud convenient seasons to renew their Vows. Which is
not to bind themselves by a new obligation, but to call to mind
in the Ι iord and confirm that by which they are already bound.
