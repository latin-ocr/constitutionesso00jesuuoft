THE CONSTITUTIONS 01⁴*

If the Founder should exact any conditions at all contrary to the
order and manner of procceding usual with the Society‚ it may
be left to the consideration of the General (after hearing the
opinions of those whom he shall think most capable of judging
in such matters) whether it will be useful to the Society, all
things being considered, with a view to God’s service, which it
has proposed to itself, to admit this College, or not. But if in
the course of time the Society finds itself burdened with the
load, it may propose and determine, in a general Congregation,
that such College be relinquished; or see that the burden be

(luly qualified for the office, who shall undertake the care of
maintaining and manag-ing their tempora] concerns, and provide
for the wants as well of the Building, as of the Scholars (who
reside in the Colleges) and of those who arc under Probation
for admission‚ and those also who without the Collcges conduct
their affairs. The conduct of the entire administration shall
remain in the Rectors: so as to enable them to render an
account, whenever and to whom the Genera] shall appoint : and
since the Genera] can neither convert the tempora] goods os the
Colleges to his own use, nor that of his relations, nor of the
