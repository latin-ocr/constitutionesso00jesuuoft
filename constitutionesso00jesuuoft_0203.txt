versed in Scholastic Divinity, and the Sam-ed Scriptures. And
although some in a shorter time are able to make no less
progress than others in a longer3 nevertheless, that some
common standard may be adopted, a distinct period of time
shall be prescribed, and this shall be four entire years spent in
Tbeology after accomplishing their studies of the Liberal Arts
and Philosophy. For any one, therefore, to be admitted to
Professionâ€š it is needful that he should have exercised himself
during this time in that faculty, and that he be sufficiently
advanced in it to the glory of God: and in proof of this
proficiency, let each man before his Profession maintain positions
in Logic, Philosophy, and Scholastic Theology. Let four be
chosen to debate and determine, whether their learning be what
it ought, as they sincerely think, according to the truth. But
if they be not found qualified with sufficient learning, it will be
better to wait until they acquire it : as they also ought to wait,
who with regard to sels-denia] and the w'rtues becoming a
religious man have not obtained such a testimonial as is meet.

' Others than these may be admitted to the profession of the
three solemn vows, although rarely, and not without peculiar
reasons of great weight3 and they too ought to have been
known in the Society at least seven years, and to have given in
it no small satisfaction of their talents and virtues to the glory
of God.

For any one to be admitted as a Coadjutor, it is necessary that
the Society be satisfied of his life and good example, and talents
to assist it either with learning in spiritual affairs, or without it
in external matters, as the divine Goodness shall have com-
municated His gifts. The pmdence of the General should
measure this, unless he has seen fit to entrust the duty to some
one in whom he has great confidence in the Lord.

To be admitted to be approved Scholars, the same things in due
proportion are required, and that in a peculjar manner : so that
in the judgment of the General, or of the person to whom he
shall have confided the duty (tmsting to the wisdom and probity
bestowed on him by God) it may be hoped from their talents
and disposition that they will turn out leamed men.
