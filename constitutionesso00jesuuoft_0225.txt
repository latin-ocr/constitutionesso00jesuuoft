THE socmTY OF JESUS. 73

another and with their head is the Love of God and our Lord
Jesus Christ, with whose divine and supreme goodness, if the.
Superior and inferiors are closely united, they will easily be
united among themselves ; and this will be effected by that
same love which coming down from God extends to all our
neighbours, and in an especial manner to the body of the So-
ciety. Charity, therefore, and to sum up all, probity and every
virtue, by which we may walk according to the Spirit of God,
will assist each party to union, and subdue every idea of
tempora] property, in which self-love, the fiercest foe of union
and the general good, habitually offends. Unanimity also in
more interna] concerns will contribute much to this; as learning,
opinions, aspirations, as far as possible: in externals als03 as
habits, the ceremonies of the Mass, and other things, so far as
the difference of persons, places, διο. shall permit.

9 A frequent intercourse of letters between inferiors and Superiors,
and immediate intelligence of one another3 and the knowledge
of all that is communicated from various places for edification,
and of all that happens, will greatly assist also ; the management
of all which shall be in the Supefiors, and especially in the
General, and the Provincials; such arrangements being made,
that in every place whatever tends to mutual consolation and
edification in the Lord may be known from the others.

IN WHAT CASES Α GENERAL CONGREGATION SHOULD BE HELD.

1 To come to the personal union which takes place in the Congre-
gations of the Society ; we must consider as well in what cases,
as what persons ought to be called together, and by whose au-
thority; where, when, and how this should take place, and what
business should be transacted in the Congregations. And in
the first place, that it may be set forth in what cases a general
Congregation and Assembly shall be held; this is especially laid
down: that it seems by no means expedient in the Lord at
present, that they occur at certain seasons or fiequently. For
the General, aided by the intercourse which he maintains with
the whole S'ociety, and the assistance of those who live with him,
shall prevent, as far as possible, so much labour and interruption
