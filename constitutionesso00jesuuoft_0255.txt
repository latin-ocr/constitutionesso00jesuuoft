which is the way to Him, and with all his energies shall aim at
this object set before him by God 3 each one according to the grace
ministered to him by the Holy Spirit, and the due place of his
vocation, lest perchance he have a zeal, but not according to know-
ledge. The determination of each member's peculiar degree, and
the appointment and entire distribution of his duties shall be 111
the hands of a Genera] or Head to be chosen by Us, that a
convenient order may be observed‚ needful in every well-regulated
community: which Chief with the advice of his associates shall
have authority to draw up Constitutions conducing to the formation
of the object proposed to 115, the larger number of votes always
having the right of determination. This Council shall be under-
stood to be the greater part of the whole Society which can be
conveniently convoked by the GeneraL on the more important and
lasting eoncerns : whilst in the lighter and more transient, all those
who shall happen to be present in the place where the Genera] shall
reside. But the whole right of issuing commands shall be in the
General. Let all the Associates know, and that not only at
their entrance into Profession, but so long as they live, let them
daily revolve 111 their mind, that this entire Society, and all its
members become God's soldiers under the faithful Obedience of the
most sacred Lord the Pope, and the other Roman Pontiffs, his
successors. And although we are taught in the Gospel, and in the
orthodox faith acknowledge and firmly profess, that all Christ's
faithful people are subject to the Roman Pontiff, as their head, and
the Vicar of Jesus Christ; nevertheless, for the greater humility of
our Society, and the perfect mortification of every member, and for
the denial of our own wills we have deemed it highly conducive.
that each one of us be bound by a special VOW‚ beyond that general
obligation, so that whatsoever the present and other Roman Pontiffs
for the time being shall ordain, pertaining to the advancement of
501115, and the propagation of the saith, and to whatever provinces
he shall resolve to send us, we are straightway bound to obey, as
far as in us lies, without any tergiversation or excuse ; whether he
send us among the Turks‚ or to any other unbelievers in being,
even in those parts called India: or to any hereticks or schis-
maticks, or likewise to any believers. Wherefore they who shall
‘join us, before they put their shoulders to the burden should
consider long and carefully‚ whether they are so rich in spiritual

goods, as to be able to finish their tower, according to the counsel
