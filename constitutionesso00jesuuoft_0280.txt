ecclesiastics, whose morals and learning were equally tried, would
be to the Catholic religion, thought fit to second the wish of so

In consequence, by our Brief, dated 7th March, 1801, we granted ¹
to the said Francis Ista-eu, and his colleagues residing in Russia, or
who should repair thither from other countries‚ power to form
themselves into a body or congregation of the Company of Jesus ;

A short time after we had ordained the restoration of the order

favour to the kingdom of Sicily, on the warm request of our dear
son in Jesus Christ, King Ferdinand, who begged that the Com-
pany of Jesus might be re-established in his dominions and states
as it was in Russia, from a conviction that in these deplorable
times, the Jesuits were instructors most capable of forming youth
to Christian piet}⁷ and the sear of God, which is the beginning of
wisdom, and to instruct them in science and letters. The duty of
our pastoral charge leading us to second the pious wishes of these
