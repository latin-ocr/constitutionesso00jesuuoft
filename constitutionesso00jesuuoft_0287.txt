THE Romsn CHURCH. 135

and resolute attachment to the cause of the Society‚ were so many
proofs of the wisdorn of those who selected hini to fill these
situations, where his zeal and his talents might be directed to the
best account. He had, it appears, from his own evidence, taken
the simple vows of the Order during his residence in England;
but doubts have arisen whether he could be lawfully aggregated in a
country where a restoration of the Society by the Pope had not
taken place, he was compelled to seek elsewhere an opportunity of
being unquestionably incorporated. The Order, most seasonably
for his purpose, had been re-established in Sicily by a special brief
of the Pope in 1804: and Mr. Kenny, therefore, proceeded to
Palermo, where in 1808 he became formally and certainly aggre-
gated as a member of the Society of Jesuits. This display of
resolution, and of indefatigable perseverance in the cause, clearly
pointed out this individua] as one whose services might be relied on
whenever a suitable opportunity should present itself for eniploying

obtain influence not over the clergy alone, but over the minds of
men of all ranks and professions ; especially of those who might
probably rise to eminence and influence in political and secular
pursuits. An attempt had, therefore, been made to erect a lay-
college within the walls of Maynooth3 but the design was defeated,
after having made some progress, by the firmness of the late ΜΓ.
Abbot, afterwards Lord Colchester, who justly thought that such
a proceeding was a plain infraction of the condition upon which
the college was endowed. The design, however, was too advan-
tageousto be altogether abandoned. Negotiations were set on
foot for the purchase of a suitable property in a convenient situa-
tion, and towards the close of 1813 an agreement was made with
the proprietor of Clongowes Wood, in the county of Kildare, and
six miles from Maynooth‚ for the surrender of that estate as the
site of the proposed lay-seminary or college. It was opened in
July 1814, for the reception of scholars; Mr. Kenny having been
appointed to the office of President. All circumstances indeed,
