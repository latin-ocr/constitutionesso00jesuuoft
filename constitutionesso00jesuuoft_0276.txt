by the Holy See; likewise the power they enjoyed of not observing
the stated fasts, and of eating flesh on fast days: likewise the
faculty of reciting the prayers called the canonic-al hours, and all
other like privileges, our firm intention being, that they do conform
themselves in all things to the manner of living of the secular
priests, and to the general rules of the church.

Further we do ordain, that after the publication of this our
letter, no person do presume to suspend the execution thereos,
under colour, title, or pretence of any action, appeal, relief, expla-
nation of doubts which may arise, or any other pretext whatever,
foreseen or not foreseen. Our will and meaning is, that the
suppression and destruction of the said society, and of all its parts,
shall have an immediate and instantaneous effect in the manner here
above set forth; and that under pain of the greater excommunica-
tion, to be immediately incurred by whosoever shall presume to
create the least impediment, or obstacle, or delay, in the execution
of this our will: the said excommunication not to be taken off but
by ourselves, or our successors‚ the Roman Pontiffs.

Further, we ordain and command, by virtue of the holy obedi-
ence, to all and every ecclesiastica] person, regular and secular, of
whatever rank, dignity and condition, and especially those who
have been heretofore of the said company, that no one of them
do carry their audacity so far as to impugn, combat, or even write
or speak about the said suppression, or the reasons and motives of
it, or about the institute of the company, its form of government,
or other circumstance thereto relating, without an express per-
mission from the Roman Pontiff‚ and that under the same pain of
excommunication.

W'e forbid all and every one to offend any person whatever on
account of the said suppression, and especially those who have
been members of the said society, or to make use of any injurious,
malevolent, reproachful or contemptuous lang-uage towards thern,
whether verbally or by writing.

We exhort all the Christian princes to exert all that force,
authority and power which God has given them for the defence of
the holy Roman Church, so that in consequence of the respect and
veneration which they owe to the Apostolic See, things may be so
ordered, that these our letters have their full effect, and that they,
attentively heeding all the articles therein contained, do publish such
ordonnances and regulations, as may prevent all excesses‚ disputes,
