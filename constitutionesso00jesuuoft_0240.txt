THE CONSTITUTIONS OF

the Genera] and itsclf, and plcasing to God. And the General
ought to acquiesce in the Society's decision.

The second relates to the care of the body, that he exceed not
prudence in laboriousness or extreme severity. In which also
the Superior shall allow himself to be brought back to modera-
tion, and shall acquiesce in the Society's judgment.

The third relates to his soul ; since even to perfect men a care of
this kind is at times necessary either as to person or duty. The
Society shall have therefore near the Genera] (and with inferiors
also this may be done) some one, who applying to God in
prayer, and having consulted the divine Goodness, and deter-

to discharge the General’s duty, -whether the General appoint

or they appoint him with the concurrence of two -local Superiors,
or of the Provincia] Rectors; or they, with the approbation of
two local Superiors‚ or the Rectors of all the Provinces elect
him by a majority of votes by letters to the government of the
Society‚ with so much power as the General shall think should
be allowed, or the Society, if it made the election.

The sixth would take place in certain cases which we hope by
thc gooducss of God and the communication of His grace will
