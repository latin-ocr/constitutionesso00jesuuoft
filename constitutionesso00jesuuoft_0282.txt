under the authority of the General ad interim, shall be admitted
and distributed, according to opportunity, in one or more houses,
one or more colleges, and one or more provinces, where they shall
conform their mode of life to the rules prescribed by St. Ignatius
of Loyola‚ approved and confirmed by the Constitutions of Paul
III. We declare besides, and grant power that they may freely
and lawfully apply to the education of youth in the principles of
the Catholic faith, to form them to good morals, and to direct
