that they, being delivered on their part from the persecutions,
dissensions, and troubles with which they have for a long time
been agitated, may be able to labour with more success in the
vineyard of the Lord‚ and contribute to the salvation of souls:
therefore, and for these motives‚ we do decree and determine, that
such of the companions as have yet made professions only of the
first vows, and are not yet promoted to holy orders, being absolved,
as in fact they are absolved, from the first simple vows, do without

pensing with the rest. Or otherwise we do permit them to live at
large, as εει-αἶαν priests and clerks, always under a perfect and
absolute obedience to tlze jzcrz‘sdietion of the Ordinary of tlte diocese
where they shall establish themselves. vWe do likewise ordain,
that to such as shall embrace this last expedient, a convenient
stipend be paid out of the revenues of the house 01· college where
they resided3 regard being paid, in assigning the same, to the
expenses to which the said house shall be exposed, as well as to
the revenues it enjoyed. With regard to those who have made
the last vows, and are promoted to holy orders, and who, either
