afterwards render themselves more useful to others with that
learning which they may have acquired. And let all these
things be done with greater zeal for God's service and glory.
Order must be observed in study, that they lay a solid founda-
tion in the Latin language sooner than in the Liberal Arts; and
in these before they attend to Scholastic Tbeology ; and in this,
before Positive Theology. The Sacred Scriptures may be taken
in hand either at the same time, or afterwards.

Those languages in which they were either written or translated
may be learned sooner or later as the Superior in the variety of
concurring causes and the difference of persons may think best.
So the order of time will be left to his prudence. But if our
Scholars apply to the study of languages, among other objects

It shall be the duty of the Rector of the College to see whether
Masters and Scholars do their duty in the Lord, or not.

Since the habit of debating is usefuL especially to the Students
of Arts and Scholastic Theology ; let our Scholars attend the
ordinary disputations of the Schools to which they belong
(though they be not under the control of the Society) and see
that they afford a distinct specimen of their learning, but with
all modesty. It is proper also that on every Sunday, or on some
other day of the week some one in our Collegc appointed by the
Rector from any Class of students, of Arts or Theology, aster
