THE SOCIETY OF JESUS. *21

amendment and spiritual improvement3 even though they be
enjoined for a defect not culpable.

16 Let a Syndic or Censor be appointed in the House, whose duty
it shall be to notice whatever relates to decorum and externa]
decency, superintending both Church and House; observing and
communicating with the Superior, or remonstrating nith him
who is in fault, if so much power is granted to him the more
effectually to discharge his duty in the Lord.

17 Let all take care to derive some profit from bodily disease,
whenever it occurs, not to their own edification only, but to that
of others also; not showing themselves impatient or morose;
but rather internally maintaining and externally manifesting
patience, and obedience to the physician and superintendent of
the sick, using pious language tending to edification‚ to prove
that sickness is accepted as a gift, since it is not less so than
health itself, from the hand of our Creator and Lord.

18 Let all think, let all speak, as far as possible, the same thing,
according to the Apostle. Let no contradictory doctrines there-

in written books, which last shall not be pztblislzed without the
approbation and consent of tlte General (who shall submit them
to the censure of three at least of learninq and clear judqnzent
in that department.) And indeed al] difference of opinion re-
garding practica] matters should be avoided as much as possible
which is usually the source of discord, and unfriendly to mutual
good-will ; and on the other hand, let union and reciproca] con-
formity be diligently upheld, and whatever is destructive of them
be discouraged: so that thus united in the bonds of fraternal
love individuals may more efficaciously and successfully employ
themselves in the service of God, and the benefit of their fellow-
creatures.

19 Since the example of the elders greatly conduces to advancement
in virtues, by which others may be animated to their imitation3
the Superior (except it is judged for particular reasons to be in-
expedient) and all the priests he may approve of, at some period
in every year shall take upon themselves the duty or duties of
those who officiate at home, that so this office may be rendered
more acceptable to others, to which they have been ordained to
the greater service and glory of God.
