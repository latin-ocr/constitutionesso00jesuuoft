THE CONSTITUTIONS OF

powers or privileges of the Society, with an abstract of them,
and a catalogue of all Houses and Colleges of the Society with
their revenues, and another of all the persons who live in each
Province, not only of the Professcd and formed Coadjutors‚ and
approved scholam, but of those also who are under probation,
wherein their names and qualities are recorded ; and he will see
that this catalogue is renewed every year, if necessary. And in
short he will keep all things in view as far as possible, that 110
may better provide in all for the divine glory.

What is said universally in the Seventh Part concerns the
Genera] more than 311 the rest, namely that the members of the
Society should not engage themselves in secular affairs, however
pious; nor should he allow himself to be occupied in them nor
any religious employments even in not pertaining to the Society,
lest his time and strength fail him for what concerns his duty,
which indeed requires more than all the man.

Nor should he be deeply occupied in the performance of parti-
cular duties pertaining to the Society, which can be performed
by others; such as the peculiar care of any House, in what
relates to its temporal support and government‚ but rather, as
before said, have his officials in every place even where he
resides himself: on whom if he cast not the whole responsi-
bility, he may 110 at least relieved by them, and freed from
attention to that duty.

So too, in every Province he shall have Provincials of such ap—
proved fidelity, and such usefulness, as one who understands that
the good government of the Society depends very much upon
them and the local Superiors. And when these are so, by
(lividing the labour with them where it may be done, and taking
care to obtain intelligence in all important cases, he will feel
that he has greater leisure and time left him to attend to general
affairs which he alone 0311 conduct. He will find that he will
have more light to perceive what is needful to be done, if his
intellect have not lost some of its original powers; as happens
to those who are overburdened with minor partieulars whereby
the strength of the intellect is often oppressed and disquah'fied
for the apprehension of general matters.

Nor has the Genera] need of officers for particular cmployments
only, as is set forth, but for the universal concerns also, and
those peculi-ar to his own duty, that he may get through them
