THE CONSTITUTIONS 01²

oF Α WILLING MISSION IN ANY DIRECTION.

CHAP. III.

ALTHOUGH they who live under the obedience of the Society
ought not to obt-rude themselves directly or indirectly into any
mission, whether sent by the Pope, or by their Superior in the
name of Jesus Christ; yet he who is dispatched to any exten-
sive region, (such as India or other Provinces) if no district is
assigned to him with express limitation‚ may remain in one
place or another, more or less, or move about as he shall think
most conducive to the glory of God weighing all circum-
stances, and using prayer, in perfect indifference as to his own
gratification. Hence it may easily be collected, if this is per-
mitted to individuals, when not repugnant to the great and chief
obedience to the Pope, that much larger power shall be given
to the Superior in missions of this kind to order them to any
one place rather than another, as he shall deem expedient iu
the Lord.

VVheresoever any one remains, if he has no orders to use any
specified method, such as lectures or sermonS, he shall employ
himself in the way which the Society adopts, as stated in
the Sixth Part, and to be set forth in the following chapter, as
he shall judge most convenient ; and on the other hand, he shall
avoid what is there ordered to be avoided, to the greater service

of God.

IN WHAT THINGS THE HOUSES AND COLLEGES OF· THE socxissTY
MAY ASSIST THEIR NEIGHBOUR.

CHAP. IV.

As the Society endeavours to aid their fellow-creatures‚ not only
by inissions to various places, but also by constantly residing in
some (as in their Houses and Colleges) : it is worth while to
observe by what method souls may be assisted in such places;
so that every possible portion may be occupied to the glory of
God.

And iu the first place, the honourable example of every Christian
virtue will conduce to the advantage of our neighboum so that
they endeavour to cdify those amongst whom they dwell‚ not
less, nay, much niorc by their good dceds than by good words.
