will 'and judqment of tlte Superior beinq set before them as the
ναῖε ⁰f their will and judqment; whereby they may more exactly
be confirmed to that chief and supreme rule of all good-will
and judgment, which is the eternal Goodness and YVisdom.

And the more to exercise themselves in the w‘rtue of Obedience,
it is expedient, and even necessary, that they obey not only the
Superior of the whole Society 01· House, but the subordinate
officers also, who have from him derived any authority, in all
those things in which they have power, and accustom themselves
not regard him whom they obey‚ but rather Him for whose sake
they obey, namely, Christ the Lord.

Let all love Poverty, as their Mother, and according to the
measure of holy discretiori let them try some of its results at
proper periods 3 and, as is set forth in the Examen, let them be

divesting themselves, as far as possible, of their love of all
creatures3 so as to turn this miiversal affection towards the
universal Creator, loving Him in all, and all in Him, according
to His most holy and divine Will.

The study to which those should apply themselves who are
under probation in the Houses of the Society should be that
which will most advance them in the aforesaid denial of them-
selves and their progress in virtue and devotion. But generally
speaking, there shall be no literary studies within our Houses,
unless a dispensation should appear necessary for peculial· rea-
sons. For Colleges have been provided for the study of Litera-
ture ; and the Houses for the practice of what they have learnt,
and for laying a foundation of humility and every virtue in those
who are to bestow their labour upon them.

least once a fortnight‚ shall refrcsh the niemory of 311 in these
