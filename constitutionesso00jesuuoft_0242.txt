THE CONSTITUTIONS oF

convoke a Congregation; namely, the Provincials with two
others whom each shall bring with him from his Province, who
shall be bound to assemble. And if the matter is divulged, and
generally known, without waiting for the summons of the four
Assistants, the Provincials ought to assemble summoning one
another: and the very first day in which they shall enter the
place of assembly, where the four who convoked them shall be

although without the name of General (so long as he lives, who
was so) τ and it shall be so arranged, if it seems good to more
than one half of the voters. If they shall not deem it neces—
sary, they shall consider whether besides those four whose
assistance the General enjoyed, the Society should provide
others, so that he being better aided and assisted thereby,
nothing essentia] to the governmeut of the Society may be
wanting. Audin this matter such resolution shall be adopted
as the majority, greater than one—half of those who are assem-
