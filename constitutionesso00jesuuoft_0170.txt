THE CONSTITUTIONS OF

conversation they may receive edification and not detriment;
and may profit in the Lord.

Let all most diligently guard the gates of their senses (of their
eyes especially, their ears, and tongue‚) from all intemperance or
vice3 and maintain themselves in peace and true interna]
humiljty, and manifest it in silence, when silence is to be
observed3 when speaking is allowed, in circumspection and

possible, have no place within our Houses.

That they may know the value of holy Poverty, let all be taught
to use nothing as their own ; although in the time of probation
it be not necessary to give up the possession of their own pro-
perty, except at the bidding of the Superior after the end of
the first year, if he think it furnishes an occasion of temptation,
and hinders any person's proficicncy in the spirit by his cleaxfing
to it with immoderate fondness and confidence; and then let
