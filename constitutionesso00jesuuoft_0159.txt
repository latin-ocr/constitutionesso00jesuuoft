THE SOCIETY OF JESUS. 7

means conducive to His greater service and glory to admit men
of unmanaqeable tempers, or unavailable to the Society, how-
ever advantageous it might prove to the individuals.

5 It is needful that those who are admitted to aid the Society in
spiritual concerns, considering what a ministry of this nature
requires that the souls of their fellow-ereatures be benefited,
be furnished with these following gifts of God.

6 As regards their intellect; of sound doctrine, or apt to learn it ;
of discretion in the management of business, or, at least of
capacity and judgment to attain to it.

7 As to memory ; of aptitude to perceive, and also to retain their
perceptions. -

8 Α5 to intention3 that they be studious of an virtue and spiritual
perfection3 calm, stedfast‚ strenuous in what they undertakc
for God’s serviem burning with zeal for the salvation of 501115,
and therefore attached to our Institute; which directly tends to
aid and dispose the 501115 of men to the attainlnent of that
ultimate end, from the hand of God, our Creator and Lord.

9 In externals ; facility of language, so needful in our intercourse
with our neighbour‚ is most desirable.

10 Α comely presence, for the edification of those with whom we
have to deal.

11 Good health, and strength to undergo the labours of our
Institute.

12 Age to correspond with what has been said; which, in those
admitted to probation should exceed the fourteenth year, and 111
those admitted to profession the twenty-fifth.

13 As the externa] gifts of nobility, wealth, reputation and the
like are not sufficient, if others are wanting3 so, if there bc a
sufficiency of others, these are not essential: so far, however, as
they tend to edification, they make those more fit for admission,
who, even without them, would be eligible on account of the
qualities before mentioned3 111 which, the more he excels who
desires to be admitted, so much the more fit will he be for this
Society, to the glory of God our Lord; and the less he excels,
50 much the less serviceable will he be. But the sacred unction
of the divine Wisdom will instruct those who undertake this
duty to His service and more abundant Praise, what standard
should be maintained in all these thingsj
