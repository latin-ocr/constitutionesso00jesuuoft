38 THE CONSTITUTIONS OF·

6 Let due diligence be employed in acquiring the proper method
of teaching the Catechism, accommodated to the intelligence of
children and ignorant persons.

7 As in the forcgoing, our neighbours are helped forward in living
well 3 so care must be taken that they be instructed in whatever
is available towards dying well: and let it be understood what
