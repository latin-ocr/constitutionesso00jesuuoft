l22 BFLL OF ‹le-:MENT XIV.

from the smallness thereos, or because they know not where to fix
themselves, or on account of age, infirmities, or other grave and
lawful reasons, do not choose to quit the said colleges or houses,
they shall be permitted to dwell therein, provided always that they
eoeercise no ministry wlmtsoever in tlte said houses or colleye& and be
entirely subject to the Ordinary of the diocese; that they make no
acquisitions whatever, according to the decree of the Council of
Lyons, that they do not alienate the houses, possessions, or funds
which they actually possess. It shall be lawful to unite in one or
more houses the number of individuals that remain ; nor shall
others be substituted in the room of those who may dje; so that
the houses which become vacant, may be converted to such pious
uses as the circumstances of time and place shall require, in con-

If, among the subjects heretofore of the Company of Jesus‚ but
who shall become secular priests or clerks, the Ordinaries shall find
any qualified by their xii-tues, learning, and purity of morals, they
may, as they see fit, grant or refuse them power of 'confessing and
preaching3 but none of them shall exercise the said holy function
without a permission in writing; nor shall the Bishops or Ordinaxies
grant such permission to such of the society, who shall remain in
the colleges or houses heretofore belonging to the society, to whom
we expressly and for ever prohibit the administratiou of the
sacrament of penance, and the function of preaching3 as Gregory
X. did prohibit it in the council already cited. And we leave it to
the consciences of the Bishops to see that this last article be
strictly observed; exhorting them to have before their eyes the
