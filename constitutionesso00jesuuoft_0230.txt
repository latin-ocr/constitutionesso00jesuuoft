shall celebrate the Mass of the Holy Ghost‚ which all shall
attend, and partake of the most blessed body of Christ in the
same.

After-wards, at the sound of a bell, those who have the right of
voting shall be summoned to the place of Congregation; and
one of them shall preach a sermon, wherein, generally, but
without giving any hint by which any particular person shall be
