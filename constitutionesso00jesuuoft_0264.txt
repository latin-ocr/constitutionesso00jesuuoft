and authority over the members of the orders thus suppressed,
commanding them to take the dress of the secular clergy, and
assigning them annuities out of the revenues of the suppressed
convents, granting witha] the permission to enter into such other
orders as they should see fit.

The same Innocent X. having considered that no spiritual ad-
vantages could be derived from the regular congregation of the
priests of the good Jesus, did, by another brief of the 22d of
June, 1651, abolish the same for ever. He submitted the said
regulars to the jurisdiction of their Ordinary, assigned them a
convenient portion of the revenues of the congregation, permitting
them to enter into any other approved order, and reserving to
himself the disposition of the goods of the said congregation, to
be applied as he should see fit to works of piety.

by his brief bearing date the 6th of December, 1668. With
regard to their goods and revenues, which were very considerable,
at the request of the republic of Venice he assigned them for the
carrying 011 the war of Candia against the Turks.

contestations before the eourts of justice, contenting themselves to
follow the laws of prudence, and relying wholly on that plenitude qf
power which they possessed in so eminent a deyree as vicars qs Christ
upon earth, (md as sovereiqu moderators qf the Christian rqmblic;
they executed all these changes without giving the regular orders,
