PREFACE. V

seems to be obscurely and incorrectly adverted to3 this book has
supplied the text from which this FIRST ENGLISH EDITION
has been faithfully and accurately reprinted.

Τὴθ partial Collation made by Mr. Penrose has been thoroughly
accomplished by subjecting the Roman Copy of 1558, to a scrutiny
with that printed at Antwerp in 1702, belonging to the University
Library vof Cambridge, and the result is appended to the Con-
stitutiones.

Of the Translation it may be sufficient to say that its only merit
is undeviating fidelity to the Original, every other consideration
being made subordinate to the essentia] object of giving the exact
sense of Loyola's legislation to the English Reader, with a view to
call his attention to the insidious practices employed by this frater-
nity of “vigorous and experienced Rowers‚” who after a suppression
of forty years have been resuscitated as one amongst “ the aids
which the special Providenee of God had put in the power'' of
the Sovereign Pontiff, to enable him to pilot “ St. Peter's Bark''
through the storms of his own raising‚ to the re-establishment of
his usurped domination over the Christian Republick.
