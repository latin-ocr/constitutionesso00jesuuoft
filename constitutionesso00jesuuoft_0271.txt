SUPPRESSION OF THE SOCIETY OF Jsssns. 119

of Lights his particular assistance under these circumstances; ex-
' horting at the same time the faithful to co-operate with us by their
prayers and good works in obtaining this needful succour.

And first of all we proposed to examine upon what grounds
rested the common opinion, that the institute of the clerks of the
company of J esus had been’ approved and confirmed in an especial
manner by the Council of Trent. And we found, that in the said
oouncil nothing more was done with regard to the said society,
only to except it from the general decree, which ordained that in
the other regular orders, those who had finished their noviciate,
and were judged worthy of being admitted to the profession,
should be admitted thereto; and that such as were not found
worthy, should be sent back from the monastery. The same
council declared, that it meant not to make any change or innova-
tion in the government of the clerks of the company of J esus, that
they might not be hindered from being usefu] to God and his
church, according to the intent of the pious institute approved by
the Holy See.

tranquillity of the Christian republic, and remove every obstacle
which may tend to trouble it3 having further considered that the
said Company of J esus can no longer produce those abundant fruits
and those great advantages‚ with a view to which it was instituted,
approved by so many of our predecessors, and endowed with so
many and extensive privileges ; that on the contrary it was very
difficult, not to say impossible, that the Church could recover α firm
and durable peace so lony as the said society subsisted ,· in consequence
hereos, and determined by the particular reasons we have here
alleged, and forced by other motives which prudence, and the good
government of the Church have dictated, the knowledge of which
we reserve to ourselves, conforming ourselves to the examples of
our predecessors, and particularly to that of Gregory X. in the
Genera] Council of Lyons; the rather as, in the present case, we
are determining upon the fate of a society classed amony the
mendicant orders, both by its institute and by its privileqes. After a
mature deliberation, we d0, out of our certain knowledqe, smel the
