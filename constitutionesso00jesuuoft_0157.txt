THE FIRST PART

OF

THE CONSTITUTIONS.

 

Of admission to Probation.

 

01²· HIM WHO HAS THE POWER OF ADMISSION.

CHAP. Ι.

l O whom the power of admitting to probation is to belong,
and how far its limits are to extend, may be left to the
judgment of the General; who, in communicating it, will con-
sider what is most conducive to the service of God and our
Lord.

2 When a person apparently fit to adopt our Institute shall apply
to one who has not this power of admission‚ he shall send him
to the party who has, or write to him, signifying what manner
of person he is who desires to be admitted, and with what gifts
of God he is endowed ; and if the other have authority to direct
in his absence, let him do that which is commanded him in the
Lord.

3 Because it greatly concerns God's service that a fit selection be
made of those who are admitted, and that diligence be used to
ascertain the particulars respecting their person and caffing:
whoso has this power of admission‚ if he cannot himself make
the inquiry, let him employ from among those who are con-
stantly about his person some one whose assistance he may use
to become acquainted with the probationers, to live with them,
and examine them; some one endowed with prudence‚ and not
unskilled in the manner which should be observed in dealing
with so many various kinds and conditions of persons; so that
this business may be managed with greater intelligence, and
more satisfaction to either party for the glory of God.
