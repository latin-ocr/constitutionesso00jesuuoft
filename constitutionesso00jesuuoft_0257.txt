INSTITUTION OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS. 105

delightful, more pure, and more conducive to the edification of our
neighbour; and since we know that our Lord J esus Christ will
supply all things needful for food and clothing to his servants
seeking only the kingdom of God3 all and singular shall vow
perpetual poverty, declaring that they cannot acquire either sepa-
rately or in common for the sustentation or use of the Society any
civil rights to any real property, or to its proceeds or incomes ε 11111;
shall be content to receive the use only of what is given them to
provide things needful. But they may have in their Universities a
College or Colleges holding revenues, estates or possessions to be
applied to the wants and necessities of the students3 the govern—
ment or superintendence of the said Colleges, and the said students,
as touching the electiori of Rectors, and students, their admission‚
discharge, reception, exclusion, the appointment of statutes for the
instruction, erudition‚ edification and correction of the students‚ the
manner of supplying their food and clothing, and all other govern-
ment, regulation and care, being always secured to the Genera] and
the Society3 yet so, that the students shall not abuse the aforesaid
goods‚ nor the Society convert them to their private use, but
minister to the necessity of the students. And these last also may
be admitted into our Society when their progress in the spirit and
in learning has been ascertained, and after sufficient probation.
All Associates whatsoever in holy orders, although they hold no
ecclesiastica] benefices, nor incomes therefrom, shall, nevertheless‚
be bound each one pflvately, and separately‚ and not as a body to
say the service according to the ritual of the Church. These
are the matters which with the allowance of our said Lord
Paul, and the Apostolic See, we can in some manner explain of
our profession: which we have now done, that by this writing we
may briefly inform not only those who question us touching our
manner of life, but our successors also, if by God's favour we shall
have followers of this way, and since we have found many
and great difficulties annexed to it, we have judged it right
to determine that no one be received into this Society‚ except he
shall have been long and diligently tried: and when he shall be·
found prudent in Christ, and conspicuous in learning, or in the purity
of the Christian life ; then at length he may be admitted to the
warfare of J esus Christ, who will vouchsafe to favour these our
humble beginnings to the glory of God the Father, to whom only
be praise and honour for ever and ever : ι Amen.
