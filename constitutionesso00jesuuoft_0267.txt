society should undergo an apostolic visitation. Sixtus V. convinced
that these demands and solicitations of Philip were just and well
founded, did, without hesitation, comply tkerewitlz; and in conse-
quence, named a bishop of distinguished prudence, virtue, and
learning, to be apostolical visitor, and at the same time deputed a
congregation of cardinals to examine this matter.

But this pontiff having been carried off by a premature death,
this wisc undertaking remained without effect. Gregory XIV.
being raised to the supreme apostolic chair, approved, in its utmost
extent, the institution of the society, by his letter sub plumbo, dated
the 28th of July, 1591. He confirmed all the privileges which
had been granted by any of his predecessors to the society, and
particularly the power of expelling and dismissing any of its
members, without any previous form of process, information, act or
delay3 upon the sole view of the truth of the fact, and the nature
of the crime, from a sufficient motive, and a due regard of persons
and circumstances. He ordained, and that under pain of excom-
munication, that all proceedings against the society should be
quashed‚ and that no person whatever should presume, directly
or indirectly, to attack the institution, constitutions, or decrees of
the said society, or attempt in any manner whatever to make any
changes therein. To each and every of the members only of the
said society, he permitted to expose and propose, either by them-
selves or by the legates and nuncios of the Holy See, to himself
only, or the popes his successors‚ whatever they should think
proper to be added, modified or changed in their institution.

Who would have thought that even these dispositions should
prove ineffectual towards appeasing the eries and appeals against the
society ? On the contrary, very violent disputes arose on all sides,
concerning the doctrine of the society, which many represented as
contrary to the orthodox saith and to sound morals. The dissen-
sions among themselves and with others, grew every day more
animated; the accusations against the society were multiplied
without number, and especially with regard to that insatiable avidity
of tempor-al possessions with which it was reproached. Hence the
rise, not only of those well-known troubles which brought so much
care and solicitude upon the Holy See, but also of the resolutions
which certain sovereigns took against the said order.

It resulted, that instead of obtaining from Paul V. of blessed
memory, a fresh confirmation of its institute and privileges, the
