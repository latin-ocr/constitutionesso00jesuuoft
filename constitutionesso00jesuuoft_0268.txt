society was reduced to ask of him, that he would condesccnd to
ratify and confirm by his authority, certain decrecs formed in the
fifth general congregation of the company, and transcribcd word
for word in the brief of the said pope, bearing date September 4,
1606. In these decrees it is plainly acknowledged, that the dissen-
sions and internal revolts of the said companions, together with
the demands and appeals of strangers, had obliged the said com-
panions assembled in congregation to enact the following statute,
namely :

“sse Divine Providencc having raised up our society for the
propagation of the faith and the gaining of souJS, the said society
ean, by the rules of its own institute, which are its spiritual arms,
arrive happily, under the standard of the Crosa at the end which
it has proposed for the good of the Church and the edification of
our neighbours. But the said society would prevent the effect of
these precious goods, and expose them to the most imminent
dangers, is it concerned itseff with temporal matters, and which
relate to politic-al afficirs, and the administration qf yovernment: in
consequence whereof it has been wisely ordained by our superiors
and ancients‚ that confining ourselves to combat for the glory of
God‚ we should not concern ourselves with matters foreign to our
profession: but whereas in these times of difficulty and danger it
has happened, through the fault perhaps of certain individuals,
through ambition and intemperate zeal, that our institute has been
ill spoken of in divers placeS, and before divers sovereigns, whose
affection and good will the Father Ignatius. of holy memory,
thought we should preserve for the good of the serw'ce of God:
and whereas a good reputation is indispensably necessary to make
the vineyard ⁰f Christ brinq forth fruits; in consequence hereof
our congregation has resolved that we should abstain from all
appearance of evil, and remedy, as far as in our power, the evils
arisen from false suspicions. To this end, and by the authority of
the present decree of the said congregation, it is severely and
strictly forbidden to all the members of the society, to intersere in
any manner whatever in public affairs, even though they be thereto
invited; or to deviate from the institute through intreaty, per-
suasion, or any other inotivc whatever. The congregation recoma
mends to the fathers-coadjutors, that they do propose and deter-
mine, with all diligcnce and spccd, such further means as they may
think necessary for rcuiedying this abuse.''
