THE CONSTITUTIONS.

vows, if they have taken them, so that all scruples may be
removed.

If they are of that description, that it would appear to be
agreeable to God not thus to give them up, more especially if
they appear to have gone away under any violent temptation, or
deceived by others, some pains may be taken to bring them
back3 and it will be lawful to use the privileges to this effect
granted by the Apostolical Chair, so far as the Superior shall
see fit in the Lord. And when any one shall be so brought
back, he shall be committed to the prudence of the aforesaid
Superior, who shall see whether any punishment be necessary, or
determine whether it may not be altogether better to proceed in
the spirit of lenity: in all which, the interest and edification‚
both of him who is brought back, and likewise of all the
inniates must be considered.

But if any one of his own accord return to the College or
House which he had left without permission, and he is thought
useful in other respects to the service of God; it must be con-
sidered whether he bring with him a true purpose of persevering,
and be ready to make any satisfaction and probation: if other-
wise, and he shows no signs of true penitence, he will not be
worthy of re-admission.

If any one who has been justly dismissed return to the House
whence he was discharged, prepared for any punishment ; if the
same reasons yet remain, for which he was dismissed; it' is
clear that he should not be re-admitted. If they do not
remam, and he who dismissed him should judge it to be agree-
able to God‚ that he be again received into the same or any
other House; let him inform the General, or Provincial, and do
what 1s commanded by him.

Whether he who returns went of his own accord, or was dis-
miss sed; if he be re· admitted, he ought to be again examined‚
and a general confession should be made, beginning from that
which he last made in the House doum to his return ; and he
shall be put to other probations and trials, as shall seem good in
the Lord to the Superior, with a view both to the general and
individua] edification.
