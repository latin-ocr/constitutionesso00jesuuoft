os tlte manner in which the whole body of the Sociely may be
mantaz'ned and iucreased in its qood estate.

INCE the Society, which was not instituted by human means,

can neither be maintained nor increased by them, but by the
Grace of Almighty God and our Lord Jesus Christ3 in Him
alone ought our hopes to be fixed, that He will preserve and
promote this work which He has vouchsafed to commence to
His own service and Praise, and the succour of souls.
And in this hope, the first and most congruous means will be
those of prayers and sacrifices, which with this hol)v intention
ought to be offered, and settled in a fixed succession, through
the several weeks, months and years, in all those places where
the Society resides.
For the preservation and increase not only of the body of the
Society, that is, of things external, but of the spirit also, and
for fulfflling the object which it proposes to itself, the succour
of souis, those means of attaining its ultimate and supernatural
end are the more efficacious which unite the instrument with
God, and dispose it to be well directed, by the divine hand,
than those which connect it with mankind. Of this sort are
probity and virtue, and above all charity, and a pure intention
of serving God, and a familiarity with God in spiritual exercises
of devotion, and a sincere zeal for souls, to the glory of Him
