THE CONSTITU'HONS 01²

(forasmuclt as we pay obedience to His place, and for His love and
reverence) leaving every other thing, not staying to finish a
letter even which the pen is tracing, in our eagerness for instant
compliance: directing all our energies to this object and inten-
tion in the Lord; so that Holy Obedience may be perfect in us
