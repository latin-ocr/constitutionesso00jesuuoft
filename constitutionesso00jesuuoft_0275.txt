Further we will, that if any of those who have heretofore
professed the institute of the company, shall be desimus of dedi-

Company of Jesus.

We likewise abrogate all the prerogatives which had been
granted to them by their Genera] and other superiors, in virtue of

they were permitted to read heretical and impious books, proscribed
