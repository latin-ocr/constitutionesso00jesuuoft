towards this society, have not been less remarkable. It is well
known, that Julius ΙΙΙ. (1550), Paul IV. (1560), Pius IV. ἃ V.
(1566), Gregory XIII. (1572), Sixtus V. (1585), Gregory XIV.
(1590), Clement VIII. (1592), Paul V. (1605), Leo XI. (1605),
Gregory XV. (1621), Urban VIII. (1623), and other Roman
pontiffs of blessed memory, have either confirmed the privileges
already granted to the society, or have explained and augmented
them.

Notwithstanding so many and so great favours, it appears from
the apostolical constitutions, that almost at the very moment of its
institution, there arose in the bosom of this society divers seeds of
discord and dissension‚ not only among the companions themselves,
but with other regular orders, the secular clergy, the academies,

different points of doctrine, concerning their schools‚ or such of
their exemptions and privileges as the ordinaries, and other civil or
ecclesiastical officers, declared to be contrary to their rights and
jurisdiction. In short, accusations of the greatest nature and very
detrimental to the peace and tranquillity of the Christian republic,
have been continually received aqainst the said order. Hence the
origin of that infinity of appeals and protests against this society,
which so many sovereigns have laid at the foot of the throne of
our predecessors Paul IV. Pius V. and Sixtus V.

Among the princes who have thus appealed, is Philip II. King of
Spain, of glorious memory, who laid before Sixtus V. not only the
reasons of complaint which he had, but also those alleged by the
inquisitors of his kingdom, against the excessive privileqes of the
society, and the form of their government. He desired likewise
that the Pope should be acquainted with the heads of accusation
laid against the society, and confirmed by some of its own members
remarkable for their learning and piety‚ and demanded that the
