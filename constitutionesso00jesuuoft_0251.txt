to us the way to God’s service and the succour of souls. With-
in the Society‚ let there neither be nor be skewn any tendency of
feelinqs for either sicle ⁰f (my fection which may perchance occur
among Christian Princes or Rulers3 but rather let there be a
certain universal love, embracing all parties in the Lord, even
though opposed to each other.

A prudent and moderate use of concessions granted by the
Apostolieal See will assist to the end most sincerely proposed by
us, the succour of souls only : For thus the divine bounty will
promote this work which He has begun; and the good odour
which depends upon the reality of good works will increase the
devotion of men; so that they will desire to be aided by the
Society, and will take care to aid it towards the end proposed,
the service and the glory of the divine Majesty.

It will be well also to pay attention to the health, and its pre-
servation in inffividuals, as is set down in the Third Part ; and
that all in short study to obey the constitutions, for which it is
needful to know them, at least as they concern the individual.
Wherefore it will be well to read or hear them every month.

On the eighth day of September, 1558, in the name of our
most holy Lord, Pope Paul IV. the most reverend Cardinal
Pachecco addressed all those who were present in the general
Congregation of our Society, and proposed the two following
things, and commanded them to be placed among the Constitu-

· tions. In each of them our Congregation said it would eomply ;

Wherefore they are placed here.

The first was, that it pleased his Holiness, that the Genera]
of our Society should be triennial, and not perpetua13 althouyh
after tlze three years lle miqht be confirmed.

The second was, that our Society should observe the canonical
hours in the choir, after the manner of the other Orders; but
with that moderation which should seem eoepedient to the General.

FINIS.
