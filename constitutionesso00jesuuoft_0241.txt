own use any of the revenues of the Colleges‚ or giving them to
any one not of the Society; or alienating any real property of
Houses or Colleges3 or holding depraved doctrine. If any of
these things should happen, the Society may and ought to
deprive hjm of his office, (if the evidence is sufficiently con-
clusive); and if need be, remove him from the Society, in all
things keeping before their eyes whatever shall be judged to be
to the greater glory of God, and the general good of the

Society.

 

OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SOCIETY SHOULD PROCEED IN
THINGS PERTAINING To THE GENERAL.

CHAP. V.

l Fnzszr, the Proxdncials whom the Genera] himself has appointed,
are bound to consider in the sight of God and do what they
ought for the general interests of the Society, in things afore-
said pertaim'ng to the General, as they shall judge in the Lord.

2 In the next place, whatever relates to the charges and care of
the General’s person, and other less important matters, needs no
general assembly; but it is necessary that the Society should
appoint four men of great discretiori and zeal for the general
good of the Society to be his Assistants. These shall reside
with the GeneraL and shall be bound in the sight of their
Creator and Lord to say and do whatever they shall judge con-
ducive to the greater glory of God touching the three things
first-mentioned in the preceding chapter.

3 The election of these four Assistants shall belong to those who
elect the General, when assembled for that purpose. But if
one should die, or it should become necessary for him for im-
portant reasons to be away from the General during a consider-
able time, the Genera] shall substitute some one else, provided
the Provincials of the Society do not object, and he shall remain
in the place of the dead or absent Assistant, with the concur-
rence of all, or of the majority.

4 In the third place, if any of those sins occur (may God forbid)
which suffice to deprive the General of his office3 as soon as
the charge is proved, by adequate evidence, or his own confes-
sion; let the four Assistants be bound by oath to denounce it to
the Society, and under the signatures of all, or three at least.
