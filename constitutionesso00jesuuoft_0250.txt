THE CONSTITUTIONS oF

jutors shall be very difficult, whilst to be Professed shall be
still more so. None others than men of the spirit and of
choice learning, long and much practised, and proved by various
trials of virtue and self-denial to the edification and satisfaction
of all, should be admitted to profession. For so whilst those
who are admitted to the Society are of this kind, although the
numbers increase, the spirit shall not be weakened nor di-
minished.

Seeing the good or evil state of the head affects the whole
body; it will be very expedient if the election of the Genera] be
such as is described in the Ninth Part. And next to this elec-
tion that will be of greatest moment, in which the subordinate
Chiefs for vainces, Colleges and Houses are appointed, For
as these are, so commonly will their subjects be. Besides elec-
tions, it is very important that the several Superiors should have
great power over their subjects, the General over them, and on
the other hand, the Society over the Genera] (as is set forth in
the Ninth Part) so that all may have all power for good ; but if
they do evil, may be altogether powerless. It is important also
that the Superiors have proper ministers (as is said in the same
part) for the arrangement and execution of business pertaining
to their duty.

Whatever contributes to the union of the members of this
Society among themselves, and with their Head will contribute
also greatly to the preservation of its good estate: such is
especially that bond of our desires‚ Charity and mutual affection,
which frequent intercourse, and communication of events, the
same doctrine, and uniformity in all things possible will cherish.
But the bond of Obedience will most effectually secure this,
which will unite individuals with their Superiors, these with one
another and with their Provincials, and all with the General‚ so
that subordination may thus bc diligently maintained by all.
Moderation in the labours of the mind and body, and the mean
in constitutions verging to neither extreme of rigour or facility
(which may most easily be observed) will conduce to the dura-
tion and prcservation of the whole body in its due estate.

It will serve to the same end generally to endeavour that the
love and charity of all, even of those without the Society to-
wards it be secui-ed, and those especially whose good or ill will
towards us is of much consequence, towards opening or closing
