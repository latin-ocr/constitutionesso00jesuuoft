RESTORATION OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS. l⁸2sl

illustrious monarchs, and having only in view the glory of God and
the salvation of souls, we by our Brief, beginning Per alias, and
dated the 30th July, 1804, extended to the kingdom of the Two
Sicilies the same concessions which we had made for the Russian
empire.

The Catholic world demands with unanimous voice the re-establish-
ment of the Company of Jesus. We daily receive to this effect
the most pressing petitions from our venerable brethren, the Arch-
bishops and Bishops, and the most distinguished persons, especially
since the abundant fruits which this company has produced in the
above countries have been generally known. The dispersion even

implored the Divine assistance, after haring taken the advice and
counsel of a great number of our venerable brothers the cardinals
of the holy Roman Church, we have decreed, with full knowledge,
in virtue of the plenitude of apostolic power, and with perpetual
validity, that all the concessions and powers granted by us solely to
the Russian empire and the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, shall
henceforth extend to all our ecclesiastical States, and also to all
other States. We therefore concede and grant to our well-beloved
son, Taddeo Barzozowski, at this time Genera] of the Company of
J esus, and to the other members of that company lawfully delegated
by him, all suitable and necessary powers in order that the said
States may freely and lawfully receive all those who shall wish to
be admitted into the regular Order of the Company of J esus, who,
