THE SOCIETY OF JESUS. 97

the administration of the Sacraments, or in short for any spiri-
tual concerns (as is declared in the Sixth Part), nor applying
the incomes of the Colleges to their own use.

It will be also of great importance for the perpetual preservation
of the Society in its prosperous condition most diligently to
remove ambition, tlte mother of all evils in every commonwealth
and society, and to preclude all approach to dignity, and the
secking of any preferment 'm the Society directly or indirectly.
To effect this, let all the Professed vow to God and our Lord
that they will never do anything to obtain it, and that they wifl
inform against any whom they discover so doing; and they
shall be accounted incapable and disqualified for any preferment,
of whom it can be proved that they solicited it. They shall
promise also to God and our Lord that they will not treat for
any preferment or dignity out of the Society, nor yield their
assent to their own election to any such office, as far as possible,
if Obedience to him who can enjoin them under penalty of sin
compel them not: but let every one consider by what means he
can promote the salvation of souls in the humility and submis-
sion of our profession; and let not the Society be deprived of
the men who are necessary to the end it has in view.

Each of the Professed shall promise also to God, that if he
should accept of any preferment without the Society, on the
compulsion above-mentioned, lze shall at all times lis-ten to the
advice of the General, or of any person appointed by lzz'm; and
if he thinks what is so recommended to be desirable, he will per-
form it; Not that he who is perferred holds any member of
the Society in the place of Superior; but that he would
spontaneously be bound in the sight of God to do that which
he shall perceive to be best for God's service ; and that he is
happy there is any one to propose it in charity and Christian liberty
to the glory of God and our Lord.

That the good estate of the whole body be perpetually main-
tained, that conduces very much which is set forth in the F irst,
Second, and Fifth Part, of not admitting a multitude of men
useless to our Institue, to probation even; and of dismissing
such as during probation are found to be unfit.

But if any are discovered of depraved morals, and of whose
amendment little hope can be felt, still less shall these be
retained. Τὴε admission to bc approved Scholars and Coad-
