THE CONSTITUTIONS OF

OF THE MANNER OF DISMISSAL.

[T will be meet to observe such a method with those who are
dismissed as shall be most satisfactory in the sight of God to
him who dismisses, to him who is dismissed, and all others
whether within or without. As to him who dismisses, for any

or without.

The first is; that great care bc taken, that no irritation be
allowed to remain in any one’s mind on accomit of the dismiss-al,
