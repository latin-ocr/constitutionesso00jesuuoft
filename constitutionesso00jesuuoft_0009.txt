PREFACE‘

WHATEVER degree of notoriety the Constitutions of the Society
of Jesus might have attained, their authoritative promulgation did
not occur until 1761, when in the course of the celebrated suit of
the MM. Lionci and Father La Valette‚* the Jesuits were “so
inconsiderate 'as to produce the mysterious volume of their institute.
By the aid of these authentic records, the principles of their
government may be delineated, and the sources of their power
investigated, with a degree of certainty and prccision, which pre-
vious to that event it was impossible to attain.’'†

The authors of this extraordinary code, conscious of the just

clamour which would be excited by its publication, obliged al]

ᾗ “Cette question fournit au parlement une occasion toute naturelle de
demandet a voir ces constitutions fameuses, qui jamais n’ avaient ete ni exam-
ἱρέες, ni approuvees avec lec formes requises. L' examen de ces constitutions,
et ensuite celui de leurs livres, a fourni des moyens J'uritliques pius que
suffisans pour declaret leur institut contraire aus loia: du royaume, ΐι ι’ οὺέιζςαησι)
