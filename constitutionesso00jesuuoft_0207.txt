01³· THOSE THINGS WHICH PERTAIN TO OBEDIENCE.

CHAP. I.

l HAT they who have been admitted to be Professed, or Co-
adjutors may devote themselves with more abundant profit
according to our Institute to the service of God, and the suc-
cour of their neighbours, they should observe certain things in
themselves: the chief of which, although comprehended in
those Vows offered up to God and our Creator according to the
Apostolical Letters, shall nevertheless be set forth, in this sixth
part, in order that they may be more distinctly declared and
recommended. And since what pertains to the V ow of Chastity
requires no explanation, it being clear how perfectly it should
be observed, namely by striving to imitate the Angelic holiness
in the purity both of our mind and body: This being stated,
Holy Obedience shall be spoken of, in which virtue all must
studiously endeavour to make large progress, not only in things
obligatory, but in others, even where there should appear the
sliqlztest indication of the Sztperior’s plettsure, without (my eaepress
command. God our Creator and Lord should be ‘set before our
eyes, for whose sake Obedience is paid to men : and care must
be taken to proceed in the calm spirit of love, and notin the
troubled spirit of fear, so that we may all strive with stedfast
purpose to neglect no point of perfection, to which by the divine
grace we can attain, in the absolute observance of all the Con-
stitutions, and the fulfilment of the peculiar object of our Insti—
tute: and may most unremittingly exert every effort in displaying
this virtue of Obedience, first to the Pope, then to the Superiors
of the Society3 so that in all things whereto Obedience pro-
ceeding from love can extend itself‚ we may be most prompt to
attend to his voice, just as if it proceeded from Christ om· Lord
