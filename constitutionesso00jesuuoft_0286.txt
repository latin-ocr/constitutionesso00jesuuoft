minished the satisfaction with which the institution was regarded
by such of the titular hierarchy as held what are termed ultra-
montanc sentiments. The heads of the Roman Catholic Church
in Ireland had generally sided with the J esuits. They are believed
to have unanimously accepted the Bull Unigenitus3 and to have
acquiesced in other edicts which had a like tendency to exalt the
papal power. They appear, therefore, to have viewed with dis-
pleasure and alarm the disposition towards J ansenism manifested at
Maynooth, and even threatening to obtain there a positive ascen-
dancy. As an instance of its prevalence may be mentioned that
Dr. Ferris, one of the Professors, a man of learning, and highly
esteemed among the pupils, had in lecturing his class ventured so
near the borders of heresy as to affirm that “the merits of the
saints, compared with the merits of Christ, were no more than a
drop of water compared with the ocean.'’ It was thence obvious
that measures could not be too speediljv taken to meet this pressing
danger, and to restore the tenets of Jesuitism to their proper
ascendancy. For the accomplishment of this object recourse was
had to the establishment of Stonyhurst; on the perfect orthodoxy
of which not a shade of suspicion had ever been cast, and which
was now in circumstances to afford very important aid. The Rev.
Peter Kenny, who had been educated partly at Stonyhurst, and
afterwards in the College of Palermo, was translated from the
former residence to Maynooth, where he filled the office of Vice-
President: that of President being at the same time held by Dr.
Murray, the present titular Archbishop of Dublin. In addition to
the proper duties of his collegiate office, Mr. Kenny was also
entrusted with the occasional charge of conducting the “ Retreats‚'’
or those seasons at which the students are accustomed to retire for
the sake of meditation and discussion. The subjects for consider-
ation at such times are fixed by the conductor, who also delivers
every day one or more hortatory discourses; and may, at the
conclusion of the Reti-eat, hear the confessions of such students as
apply to him. Mr. Kenny thus enjoyed most ample and favourable
opportunities of inculcating the principles of his order, and of
eradicating any opinions of an opposite complexion which, through
his intimate acquaintance with the most secret sentiments of the
students, he might discover the slightcst tendency in any of them
to adopt. The testimonies which he had given of the most devoted
