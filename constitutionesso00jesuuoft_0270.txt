Christian republic. Indeed, this letter was rather extorted than
yranted, to use the expression of Gregory X. in the above-named
General Council of Lyons.

After so many storms, troubles, and divisions, every good man
looked forward with impatienee to the happy day which was to
restore peace and tranquillity; but under the reign of this same
Clement XIII. the times became more difficult and tempestuous3
complaints ancl quarrels were multiplicet on every sz'de ; in some places
(langley-ons seclitz'ons arose, tmnults, discords, dissensions, scandals,
which wealceniny or entirely breakiny the honds qf Christian charity,
