to serve God and our Lord elsewhere.

But if the matter be not so clear to the Society as it ought,
when he who desires to be admitted has expressed his wish,
and has been interrogated with delicacy on the chief impedi-
ments, and has comprehended the object of our Institutc,
together with the probations and difficulties inherent therein;
although he may seem earnestly to desire to be admitted into
the Society, to live in it for ever, (without which desire no one
ought to be admitted to probation) still, the reply, and the final
determination may be put off for awhile3 that, in the interval
the matter may be better considered, and commended to G0d;
and proper diligence be used; that he may be more thoroughly
scrutinized, and his stedfastness be put to the test. How long

the purpose; and on the following day it shall be declared to
him, how he should conduct himself in that place; and ex-
pressly, that he hold no intercourse, unless for some cause of no
slight moment it seems otherwise to the Superior, either by word
or writing, with those within or those without, except with such
as are for that purpose designated by the Superior3 which is
done, that he may more freely weigh with himself and with God
his calling, and resolution of serving the divine and supreme
Majesty in this Society.

Two or three days after his entrance into the house of pro-
bation, a more accurate examination may be commenced, as is
set forth in the duty of the Examiner; and a written examina-
tion may be left with him, that he may more maturely consider
it alone; then, the Apostolic Diplomas may be shown to him 3
and the Constitutions; and the Rules to be observed in the
Socicty, and in the house which he enters; and those who
have paid attention to literature, may read distinct lessons in
