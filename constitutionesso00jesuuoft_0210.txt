THE CONSTITUTIONS OF

suhsist on alins, they also shall live in the same way. If they
are Rectors of Colleges, or Lecturers, or useful in any other
necessary or advantageous employments, they shall live as the
others do, out of the College-rcvenues, so long as these shall
require their service. When they shall cease to be useful to the
Colleges, let them no longer live in them ; and they shall dwell
in the Houses of the Society, as is said of the Professed.

Not only shall the Houses and Churches of the Society have no
revenues‚ but not even any possessions whether peculiar or com-
mon, except what is needfuL or exceedingly convenient to them
for habitation or use; of which kind it might be considered
if a place were allowed remote from general habitation, enjoying
a salubrious air, and other advantages, for the use of the con-
valescent, or of those who withdraw from the intercourse of the
world to be at leisure for spiritual concerns; and even then it
shall not be let out to others, nor produce anything which may
be looked upon as revenue.

Although it is praiseworthy to incite men to good and holy
works, and especially to such as shall endure for ever; yet for
greater edification no member of our Society ought nor is
allowed to stimulate any one to leave perpetual alms to the
Houses or Churehes of this Society: and if any persons leave
such spontaneously‚ no civil right is acquired to secure them, so
that he who refuses to pay them can be sued for them. But
when the Love of God moves them to do so, then they may
bestow them.

All who are under Obedience to the Society should remember
that they ought to give gratuitously what they have gratuitously
received, neither demanding, nor receiving pay, or alms, by
which Masses, or Confessions, or sermons, or Lessons, or Visi-
tations‚ or any other duty of all those which the Society can
render according to our Institute, may appear to be remunerated 2
that so it may proceed with greater liberty and edification of our
neighbours in God's service.

To avoid all appearance of covetousness‚ especially in offices of
piety which the Soeiety discharges for the snccour of souls, let
there be no box in the church, into which alins are generally put
by those who go thither to Sermons, Mass, or confession, and
other spiritual concerns.

For the same reason let no trifles be presented to the great
