shall determine to send us, amongst believers or unbelievers, to
the greater glory of God and the succour of souls. Nor has
the Society had in view any particular part3 but that it may
be scattered by him in divers regions and countries throughout
the world: seeing it would of itself select the most beneficial
course, and would expect no other, if the chief Pontiff should
direct the distribution of its members.

And on this point, since the Society has engaged every thought
and will of its own to Christ our Lord, and his Vicar, neither
the Genera] of the Society for himself, nor any subordinate
member for himself or for another may directly or indirectly
treat or negociate with the Pope or his Ministers, to remain or

regard the general good, and how other duties undertaken for
the service of God may sustain the least injury.

party thus sent, and the object of the Pope's intention3 and, if
possible, in writinq, that what is enjoined him may be more
exactly accomplished. The Superior will take care to assist him
with advice and instruction, as far as possible, so that he may
more usefully discharge his duty in all things to the service of
God and the Apostolic See.

If he be sent to particular places, without the specification of
any period by the Pope: let it be understood that he shall
