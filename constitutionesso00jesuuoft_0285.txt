as conveniently prepared for the accommodatiori of 150 scholars.
In addition to the pupils whose circumstances enabled them to pay
the regulated charges for boarding and tuition, it was generally
understood that a certain number of the children of poorer parents
were received, for gratuitous education, upon the foundation of the
college ; who might be afterwards adopted into the Society and
employed in forwarding its designs, as they should be found to

the exertions of those judiciously planted agents who were issuing
yearly from the college, the immediate successors of that feeble
band which had professed to seek no more than a refuge from
overwhelming missortune, found themselves in a situation to extend
their exertions beyond the limits of England,

The Parliamentary foundation of the College of Maynooth had
given in Ireland the first promise of a revival of Roman Catholic
