lest through the constitution of our frail nature they cease from the
performance of them in forgetfulness. And several times every
year let all petition the Superior that penances be enjoined thern
for neglecting the observation of the Rules; that this concern may

CHAP. II.

As overmuch solicitude in those things which pertain to the
body is reprehensible; so a moderate regard for the preservation
of health and strength of body to the service of God is com-
mendable, and to be observed by all : and for this reason, when-
ever they discover anything to be hurtful to them, or anything
to be necessary for· their food‚ clothing, habitation, attention to
duty, or other things, let all inform the Superior, or whomsoever
the Superior may appoint, observing, in the interim, two things:
first, that before they refer anything to him, they betake them-
selves to prayer 3 and after prayer, if they still think the matter
should be communicated to the Superior, let them do so :
secondly, when they have briefly explained it to the Superior,
verbally, or in writing (that it may not escape his memory) thev
leave to him the entire settlement of the question, and consider
whatever he determines to be best3 nor proeeed to argue or
urge it, either themselves or by another (whether that which is
desii-ed be conceded or not) seeing they should persuade them-
selves that what the Superior determines after due consideration
is most conducive to the divine pleasure, and their own benefit.
Let a time for eating, sleeping and rising be appointed for
general observation.

In all those things which relate to food‚ clothing, habitation, and
other things needful for the body, let care be taken with the
divine aid, that in every probation of virtue and act of self-
denial, nature be nevertheless sustained and preserved for the
honour of God, and His service, due regal-d being paid to persons
iu the Lord.
