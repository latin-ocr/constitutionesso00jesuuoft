OF INSTRUCTING OUR SCHOLARS IN THOSE THINGS WHICH RELATE
To THE SERVICE OF THEIR FELLow-CREATURES.

CHAP. VIII.

l LOOKING to the object to which the studies of our Society are
directed, it will contribute to that end, that they begin to
habituate themselves to wield their spiritual weapons for the
benefit of their neighbours. For although this should be done
in our Houses more properly and continuously, it should yet be
commenced in our Colleges.

2 First of all, those who in the judgment of the Superior are to
be admitted to sacred orders, should be instructed in the method
of saying Mass, so that besides intelligence and interna] devo-
tion, they may exhibit a becoming external manner to the
edification of the hearers: and that all the Society, as far as
possible, may use the same ceremonies ι in which so far as the
variety of countries shall allow, it shall follow the Roman prac-
tice as being more general, and that which the Apostolic See has
adopted in a more peculiar manner.

3 Let them accustom themselves also in setting forth their sermons

- and sacred lectures to the way best adapted for the edification of
the people, which differs from the Scholastic method3 and to
discharge this duty let them labour to acquire the vernacular
tongue of the country thoroughly. There are other things
which they should have studied, and have at their fingers’ ends,
which will be useful to this duty3 and in short, they should
employ all means which may assist them to discharge this office
the better, and with greater spiritual profit to others.

4 Let them be accustomed also to the ministration of the Sacra-
ments of Confession and Communion, and endeavour to compre-
hend and discharge that duty not only as relates to themselves
but also to the penitents and communicants, that they may
understand and receive the same duly and usefully to the glory
of God.

5 Let them accustom themselves to communicate their spiritual
exercises to others, when each has experienced them in himself;
and let all be diligent not only to give an explanation of them,
but also to acquire a readiness in wielding this kind of spiritual
arms which by the grace of God is felt to contribute so largely
to His service.
