THE CONSTITUTIONS OF

open his conscience. Which Confessor ought not to be at a loss
what cases should be reserved for the Superior. Th0se then
shall be reserved which shall seem necessary or highly expedient
to be known by him; in order that he may the better apply a
remedy, and preserve those committed to his care from all things
hurtful.

It will be highly usefuL that there be in every House a faithful
man, sufficiently skilled in spiritual concerns, to instruct and
teach them how they ought to behave themselves, both inter-
nally and externally‚ according to the Society's Institute and
religion ; and to encourage, remind, and lovingly persuade them
to it: whom all under probation should love, to whom they
should have recourse in their temptationS‚ disclose all their con-
cerns with confidence‚ and from whom in all cases they may
hope for consolation and assistance in the Lord: and let them
be admonished to hide no temptation, but to disclose it either to
him, to their Confessor, or to their Superior ; nay more, to take

mortifications, their devotions‚ and all their virtues ; desiring
with perfect concurrence to be guided by them, wherever they
have deviated from the direct path; and not wishing to be led
by their own jztdyment‚ except it agrees with that of those who
are to them in stead qs Christ our Lord.

when an individua] is observed to be disposed to pride, he should
be employed in the more abject occupations which may seem
good to humble him, and so of the other depraved propensities
of the soul.

Moreover, it is a matter of propriety and decency, that no
woman enter our Houses and Colleges, but our Churches only;
and that neither arms nor other instruments of vanity be
allowed, but only those things which conduce to the object
which the Society has in view, the service and praise of God.
What measure should be observed in enjoining penances and
corrections, must be left to the prudent charity of the Superior,
and those whom he has deputed: who in these matters will regard
the dispositions of persons, and the general and individual edifi-
cation to the glory of God. Every one must undergo penances
of this sort with prompt compliance and an unfeigned desire of
