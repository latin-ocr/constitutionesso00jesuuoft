of the lectures; see that they are repeated, and that the
Students in Humanity cultivate their conversational powers,
speaking Latin and improving their style by writing: enjoining
frequent disputations, and especially on the superior students3
for which certain days and hours shall be appointed, when they
shall debate, not only with their equals, but the inferior with the

except Latin, whether they should be engaged in before or after
Arts and Theology, and how long each Student should apply to
them. So in any of the higher Sciences, he shall settle with
due regard to the inequality of talents and age, when each
should commence and how long occupy himself in them: a]-

intcllect should endeavour to advance in all, and become con-
spicuous to the glory of God.

tion also. Although it shall bc left to the Rector to consider
what ‘this should hc, and at what pmiods, the circumstances of
persons and places being attendcd to.
