THE CONSTITUTIONS 01⁷

dinner should undertake some positions to be maintained (if no
impediment intervene from any peculiar cause) to be affixed to
the School-doors the previous evening, where all who please may
assemble to dispute or listen ; which being briefly stated by him
who is to reply, it shall be permitted to all to debate whether
within or without our College ; but some one should preside to
moderate the debaters, and elicit and demonstrate to the benefit
of the audience the doctrine which ought to be held : and also
to give the signal to those who dispute to conclude, and so to
divide the time that an opportunity of speaking be allowed to all
as far as possible.

Besides these two sorts of disputations above-mentioned, let a
time be set on each day, for debating in the Colleges‚ a mode-
rator being appointed, as we have said: so that, by these means,
their talents may be exercised, and the difficulties which occur
in these faculties may be the better elucidated to the glory of
God.

Those who are studying polite literature shall have their ap-
pointed times also for conferring and disputing on what pertains
to those studies, before some one who shall direct them; and on
Sundays, or other appointed days after dinner they shall alter-
nately either maintain positions in their own studies, or exercise
themselves in writing verse or prose; whether it be done ez-
tempora the subject being thcn proposed to discover their readi-
ness ; or whether they read in public what they have composed
in private on a theme previously given them.

Let all speak Latin commonly, but especially the Students in
Humanity, and commit to memory whatever shall be set by their
Masters, and diligently cultivate their style in composition: and
let some one take the trouble to correct them. It shall also be
allowed to some, at the Rector’s pleasure, to read certain other
authors in private, besides those which are publicly studied; and
every week on an appointed day, after dinner, let one of the
more advanced pronounce a Latin or Greek oration on a subject
tending to the cdification of the inmates, by which they may
be animated to greater perfcction in the Lord.

Morem-er, the Students of Arts and Theology especially, and
all the others should have their private quiet study, where

they may leam better and more exactly what has been treated
of.
