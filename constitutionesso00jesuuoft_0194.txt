THE CONSTITUTIONS ΟΡ·

OF ADMITTING UNIVERSITIES INTO THE SOCIETY.

CHAP. XI.

THE same reason in charity‚ for which Colleges are admitted,
and public Schools maintained in them not only for the edifica-
tion of our own Scholars, in learning and morals but still more
of those that are without, may be extended to the undertaking
of the care of Universities; that in them this benefit may be
enlarged, and be wider spread as well in the Sciences which are
taught as in the men who frequent them, and the degrees to
which they attain ; so that in other places they may teach with

authority, what they have in these thoroughly learned to the
glory of God.

On what conditions and obligationS‚ and in what places these
Universities shall be admitted, is left to the judgment of the
General of the Soeiety: who having heard the opinions of his
Assistants, and of others whom he may choose to consult, shall
determine within himself whether they shall be admitted. But
when they have been once admitted he shall have no power to
dissolve them without the concurrence of a Genera] Congrega-
tion.

Since religious peace and spiritual occupations allow not that
distraction of mind nor other annoyances to the Society which
attend the duty of judging in civil or crimina] proceedings, no
jurisdiction of this kind shall be permitted which the Society
might exercise either of itself, or by others depending on it:
although it is proper in all that peculiarly relates to the welfare
of the University that the ministers of ordinary Justice whether
secular or ecclesiastical should fuffil tlte pleasure of the Rector
of thc University as signified to them touching the punishment
of its Scholars, and generally promote the interests of learning.
especially when recommended to theru by the Rector.
