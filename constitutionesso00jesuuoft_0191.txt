THE SOCIETY or JESUS. 39

towards the conclusion of this period the Rector shall under-
stand that it is his duty to inform tlte General ον Provincial, and
represent what proficiency they have made; and then he shall
follow whatever instructions he may receive to the glory of God.

 

OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COLLEGES.

ΤΗΕ Professed Society shall have the supreme care or superin-
tendence of the Colleges according to the letters of the Apostolic
See. For since the Professed cannot apply any portion of those
revenues to their private advantage or their own use ; it is most
consonant to reason that they will proceed with greater purity
and religion more constantly and pei-severingly in those things
which are necessary to the good government of the Colleges to
the greater service of God and our Lord.
Eaecept what relates to the Constitutions, ancl the dissolettion ον
alienation qs our Colleqes, the whole power and administrativa, and
(generally speaking) the eoeeeutioa of this superintendence shall
belong] to the GeneraL who keeping before his eyes the object
towards which the Colleges and the Society at large are directed,
shall best perceive what is beneficia] for them.
The Genera] himself therefore, or some one empowered by him
for this duty, shall appoint one of the Coadjutors of the Society
to preside over each College; who shall give an account of the
duty assigned to him to the Provincial, or whomsoever the
General shall nominate. And the Genera] also may remove the
Rector, and relieve him from his responsibility‚ as shall appear
to him most desirable in the Lord.
Care should be taken that he who undertakes the office of
Rector should be most exemplary, of great edification, and strict
mortification in all depraved inclinations, and tried especially in
Obedjence„ and in humility; one endowed with discretion, skilled
in government, versed in business, and experienced in spiritual
concerns3 knowing how to interchange severity with mildness
in due time and place, anxious, laborious, learned; in short one
in whom the Superiors may confide, and to whom they may
safely communicate their power; since, the ampler this autho-
rity, the more effectually the Colleges will be directed to the
greater glory of God.
