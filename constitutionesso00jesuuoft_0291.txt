THE Romsn cutmen. 139

unanimous conclusion was, that the Jesuits did not compensate,
even by their exertions on behalf of the Church, for the horrible
mischiefs of which they were in other respects the authors. Yet
the head of the Church of Rome restored this Society in all its
plenitude; neither accompanying his rescript with any refutation
or denial of the odious doctrines and practices which had been
imputed to it, nor expressing his own disapprobation of them, nor
so much as giving a public cantion against their re-introduction.
The only reason dwelt upon in justification of his proceeding is
the security of the Church. Placed as he is in the bark of St.
Peter, and tossed with continual storms, he should (leem himself on
his pontifical responsibility guilty of a great crime towards God, if
he should neglect to employ “THESE VIGOROUS AND EX-
PERIENCED ROWERS” who volunteer their services. Verily
it must be assumed that the end sanctifies the means, or how
could the Church have lent its sanction to the restoration of a
fraternity which the Church itself had condemned and snppressed
as the sources of ineffable enormities ἓ

But whether the Church of Rome is prepared to justify this
proceeding‚ or whether, having resorted to it in a moment of
desperationg yet now, finding how well it has answered, she will
set all censure at defiance, the consequence to ourselves is precisely
the same. Τὶιθ Society being restored and once again planted in
England, has directed all its energies to recover for the Roman
Catholic Faith, its lost dominion over the people. Other of the
regular orders, encouraged by tho example of the Jesuits, have
resumed operations. Six Colleges, besides Stonyhurst, under the
direction of one or other of these orders, are now in actii-ity- upon
a very extended scale, in various parts of the l<ingdom; and, as
described in the Laity's Directory for the present year, the Roman
Catholic Chapels in England and wales are in number 4103< A

 

²¹² It will thus appear from the accounts that have reached your Com-
mittee—chiefly from the published statements of Roman Catholics them-
selves—that there are now 519 chapels open for service, and 43 in progress of

erection in this island.
