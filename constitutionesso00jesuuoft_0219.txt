THE SOCIETY OF JESUS. 67

to their own fiock, or other interests more remote from
our Institute, than the common or general concerns; let the
General or his deputy diligently look to these missions, that in
sending his subordinates to one part rather than another, and to
one duty rather than another, and one person rather than ano-
ther, in this or that method, for a longer or a shorter period,
whatever is most conducive to the greater service of God, and
the general good may always be determined on. With this
most upright and sincere intention maintained in the sight of
God and our Lord; and the subject being commended to the
divine Majesty in his prayers and sacrifices and those of the
inmates, should this seem needful on account of the difficulty or
importance of the deliberation ; and also being communicated to
some one or more of the Society then at hand; he shall of
himself determine, whether to send or not; and so of other
circumstances, as he shall deem most conducive to the greater
glory of God. And it shall be his duty who is sent to yield the
full and free disposal of himself to his Superior, who qoverns
lcim in C'lzrz'st’s stead, to His greater service and glory, without
in any way interfering to procure his going, or staying in one
place rather than another. In like manner no one ought to
trouble himself in any way for others to remain in any place, or
remove elsewhere without the consent of his Superior, by whom
he is governed in the Lord.

&Vhithersoever the Superior shall send any one, he should in-
struct him perfectly (and qenerally in writiny) as well in the
method of proceeding, as the means which he wishes him to
employ to attain the object which he has in his mind. Being
inforrned as far as possible by the frequent interchange of letters
of the whole issue, from the place where he resides, he will
provide by his counsel and all other assistance which can be
rendered, as persons and things require, that the greater senice
of God be accomplished, and the general good forwarded by
the members of the Society: which ought to be attended to
with the more diligence, as the character of the business,
whether onerous or difficult, and of the missionaries‚ whether
requiring counsel or instruction, may demand.
