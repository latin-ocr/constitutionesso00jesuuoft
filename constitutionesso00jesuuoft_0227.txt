discretion of the General, who under occurring circumstances
shall determine whether a provincial meeting shall be held for
the election of these two, or whether the Provincial without a
meeting shall choose them, as he shall deem expedient in the
Lord. To these three the whole Proxince shall entrust its in-
terest, and whatever shall be settled by the general assembly
in which they attend, shall be established. If besides these two
delegatesl the General shall appoint certain others, or the Pro-
vincial resolve to bring them, their right shall be the same as
the rest. But if beyond the three, the Provincial should select
more; he shall not add more than two, so that, in all, five may
come from one Province.

Of the Professed who shall attend in the Assemblv, each shall
have a single vote, the General alone shall have two. But if
the numbers are equal, the Provincials shall be preferred to the
rest3 and if among the Provincials there is an equality, that
part to which the General, or, in case of his death, his Vicar
shall incline, shall have the preference. For as the help of the
divine Grace is more 'necessary to them by reason of the office
they bear, it is to be hoped that God and our Lord will more
largely bestow it on them, that so they may think and speak
whatever tends to His glory.

To WHOM IT BELONGS TO CALL A GENERAL CONGREGATION.

WHEN the Society is to be assembled to elect a new General,
on the death of the former, one of the Professed‚ whom the
General has nominated before his death to be his Vicar in this
respect shall take care to inform the rest of that event. This
Vicar shall be for the most part one of those assistants usually
about the General, or at least, one of those who live near him.
His duty will be to summon the Society to the election of the
General, the time and place being named for their attendance.

When the Society is not summoned to an election, in other
cases the General shall convoke it, except in those to be set
forth in the Ninth Part z and as before said, he shall not call the
Society together frequently, except the necessity of its affairs
