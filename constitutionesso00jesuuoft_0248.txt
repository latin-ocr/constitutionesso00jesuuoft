THE FONSTITUTIONS OF

who created and redeemed them, all other gain being disre-
garded. It seems therefore to be an object of universal care, that
all who unite themselves to this Society give themselves to the
study of the solid and perfect virtues, and of spiritual concerns,
and consider that more depends on these than on learning or
other human and natural gifts. For these are the more internal
means, from which efficacy should be derived in the more
external towards the object proposed by us.

This foundation being laid, the natural means which procure the
instrumentality of God and our Lord in what regards our neigh-
bours, will conduce entirely to the preservation and increase of

for it. And these shall be the nursery to the professed Society,
and its Coadjutors: and if with the CoHeges, Um'versities also
arc committed to the care of the Society, and the method of
proceeding described in the Fourth Part is observed, it will con-
tribute to the same end.

And since Poverty is as the strongest rampart to Religious Orders,
to maintain them in their due estate and discipline, and defend
them from numerous enemies (for which reason the Devil labours
to dcstroy it in various ways) it greatly concerns the security and
extension of the whole body entirely to remove every appearance
of avaricc3 acccpting no revenucs, nor possessions, nor stipends
for preaching the word of God, or lectures, or masses, or for
