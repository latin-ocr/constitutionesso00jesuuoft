THE CONSTITUTIONS OF

approved Students are adopted into the body of the Society in a
more intimate manner than those admitted to Probation; in this
fifth part shall be said what appears needful to be observed in
the Lord‚ concerning their admission.

First, the power of admitting into the body of the Society such as
ought to be admitted, shall be vested in its head; as reason
demands. But as the Genera] cannot be present in every place,
he may communicate to others of the Society so much of this
power, as shall seem advantageous to the whole body.

The time for admission in the aforesaid manner, generally
speaking, should be after two years ; but if any one should have
been long observed before he is sent to his studies, or whilst
occupied in them, he shall still have a whole year of probation
after he has accomplished them, if he is to be admitted to
Profession3 that he may be still further observed, before he
engages in it. And this time may be protracted, as is set forth
in the Examen, when the Society, or he who holds this duty of
it in the Lord‚ desires to be further satisfied.

subordinate Governors shall refer, or others whose testimony the
General shall require. It will much conduce to this, for those
who have been sent to their studies, having bestowed that care
and diligence which was necessary to the culture of the intellect,
to exercise themselves diligently in schooling their affections
through the period of their final probation, and to be very
earncst iu the spiritual and bodily exercises which pertain to
their improvement in humility, in the denial of all sensual love,
of their own will and private judfflnent, and in the greater know-
ledge and love of God: so that when these feelings have pre—
dominated in their own hearts, they may better assist others in
thc progress of the Spirit to the glory of God and our Lord.

Their instruction of this kind must be sufficient, and besides
Humanity and the Libera] Arts, they ought to be adequately
