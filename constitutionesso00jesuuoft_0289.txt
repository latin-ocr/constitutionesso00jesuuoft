'run ROMISH CHURCH. 137

and certainly, when it is considered what crowds are attracted to
Rome of Protestants ill-grounded in the principles of their own
faith, and most favourably situated for receiving the desired
impression, as well as how extended may be their influence in
multiplying the same impression on their return home, this source
of conversions is not to be thought lightly of. An Institution of
more direct influence is “ the English College '’ at Rome, which is
carefully cherished and mainly relied on, as an effective instrument
for advancing the cause of the Romish Church in this country. A
very remarkable proof of the deep policy by which it has recently
been thought worth while to attach the students of this institution
by redoubled ties to the service for which they are destined, was
afforded in October, 1827; when, for the first time during several
centufies, the Pope himself visited their summer retreat about
fourteen miles from Rome. A very striking account is extant,
written by a former student of Stonyhurst, but then a member of
the English college, who was present on the occasion. A most
animated picture is drawn of the extreme affability and condescen-
sion of His Holiness, allowing them to kiss his foot and his hand,
blessing their beads, dining at their table, conferring upon them as
they knelt before him the very significant appellation of “the hope
os the Chur0h‚'' and after his departure sending them as a present
a beautiful young calf, ornamented with fiowers, and moreover
issuing directions to his masters of ceremonies that in the pro-
cession of Corpus Christi the students of the English College
should carry the Baldacchino, or hangings, which are borne over
the Pope as he carries the Holy Sacrament. Such attentions are
not lavished without an object; and when the period chosen for
this manifestation is considered in connexion with other well-
known circumstances, but slender doubts can remain as to what is
‘⁴ the hope of the Church,” or how it is expected to be realized.
These, among many other indications furnish the ground upon
which it is assumed that a design is now in progress of execution,
for re-establishing in England the Roman Catholic Religion. Τ116
chief agency is evidently entrusted to the J esuits3 upon which part
of the subject an observation must be offered, which highly con-
cerns all who even without any particular regard for religion, are
anxious for the general welfare of the community. The restora-
tion of that order by Pius VII. has given compactness and
momentum to elements which before that were scattered and
