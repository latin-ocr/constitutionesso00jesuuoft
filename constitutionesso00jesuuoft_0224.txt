THE CONSTITUTIONS 01⁷

Subordination duly maintained among the Superiors themselves,
of whom some are subject to others, and of inferiors towards
them, pertains to this virtue of Obedience, so that all who reside
in any House or College should refer to their local Superior, or
Rector, and permit themselves to be ruled by him in all things.
But they who reside apart in any province in various places must
refer to the Provincia] or some local Superior nearer at hand;
as they shall be commanded. But all local Superiors or Rectors
shall hold frequent communication with the Provincial‚ and con-
duct themselves in all things according to his pleasure. In the
same way shall the Proxincials behave to the General. For
thus, subordination being observed, union which entirely depends
upon it, will by the Gracc of God be maintained.

If any one shall seem to be the author of division or dissension
among those who live together, or with their Head ; he shall be
separated with all diligence from that Congregation, as a plague
which will infect the whole, if an immediate remedy be not ap-
ph'ed.

On the part of the General, these are the qualities which con·-
duce to this mental union, and with which, as is set forth in the
Ninth Part, he ought to be endowed: and provided with these, he
shall do his duty to every member of the Society‚the duty, namely,
of Head, namely, from whom the influence necessary to the office
assigned to him shall descend : and thus, from the General, as
from the Head, all the power of the Provincials shall issue, and
through them to local Superiors, and through them it shall reach
individua] members: so also, from the same Head (or at least
from his deputation of authority, and with his approval) shall
the missions proceed. Let thus much suffice on the communi-
cation of the powers of the Society. For the' more inferiors
depend upon their Superiors, the better the love of obedience
and Union will be preserved between them.

And to the end that position may be more conducive to the in-
tercourse of the head with its menibers; it wffl be most proper
that the General should chiefly reside at Rome, where he can
enjoy the readicst intercourse with all other places of the Society.
Provincials also shall settle for the most part where convenient
communication may be held with the subordinates, and with the
General, so far as it can be arranged in the Lord.
