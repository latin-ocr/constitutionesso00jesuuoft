God’s service3 so that contributing to the succour of souls in
the neighbourhood, after a while he may return to the place of

service of God) he may and ought to consider in what other

General either by himself or by another shall be obliged to
declare to his Holiness the profession and express promise 9f
Obedience, by which the Society has bound itself by its peculiar
Vow regarding missions to the glory of God.
