THE SOCIETY OF JESUS. 93

well and pleasantly. Itis needful therefore that he have some
one to assist him, in his anxiety to attend to so many points
of duty, by recalling things to memory 3 in the arrangement of
business; by good advice; and lastly, in his exertions to ac-
complish them, by diligence and labour. For it is evident that
the memory of no one man is sufficient for the recollection of
so many things3 nor were that possible, could the intellect of
any one be equa] to their full consideration and arrangement3
nor were that also possible, could the powers of any one suffice
for their performance.

For the first point then, namely, the solicitude of attending to
every thing, there is need of some minister ordinarily to reside
with him, and to strengthen both his memory and his hands in
things to be written and transacted, and in short to take upon

his duty is laid upon his shoulders.

This minister of the Genera] should be a careful and discreet
man, and if possible, endowed with the gift of learning, of an
agreeable aspect and manner in dealing with all kinds of men,
personally and by correspondence; a man especially to whom

and from the feebleness of the human intellect, which cannot
sustain its attention when distracted by so many concems, or at
least is not equa] to the ascertaining and providing what is
needful in every respect. It seems therefore absolutely neces-
sary, that certain men celebrated for learning and all other gifts
of God, may reside with the Superior to assist him, and take
upon them the care of considering with peculial· solicitude all
the affairs of the Society committed to them by the General,
which he may divide among them, thereby the more accurately
to examine every thing ; as, one to inspect the concerns of In-
dia; another of Spain and Portuga13 another of Germany and
France; and another of Italy and Sicily; and so of the rest,
when the Society is scattered over other parts. And every one
